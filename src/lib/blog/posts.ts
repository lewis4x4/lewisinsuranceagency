## Understanding Florida Homeowners Insurance

Florida's homeowners insurance market is unique. Our coastal location, hurricane exposure, and recent market challenges mean Florida homeowners pay more than most states—but understanding your options can help you find the right coverage at a competitive price.

### What Does Homeowners Insurance Cover?

A standard Florida homeowners policy (HO-3) includes several types of coverage:

**Dwelling Coverage**
This covers your home's structure—walls, roof, floors, and built-in appliances. Your dwelling limit should reflect the cost to rebuild your home at current construction prices, not your purchase price or tax value.

**Other Structures**
Covers detached structures like garages, fences, sheds, and pool equipment. Typically 10% of your dwelling coverage.

**Personal Property**
Protects your belongings—furniture, clothing, electronics, and more—from covered perils. Consider whether you need replacement cost or actual cash value coverage.

**Liability Protection**
If someone is injured on your property and you're held responsible, liability coverage protects you. Most policies include at least $100,000, but higher limits are often recommended.

**Loss of Use**
If your home is damaged and you can't live there during repairs, this pays for temporary housing and additional living expenses.

### What's NOT Covered

Standard Florida homeowners policies exclude several important perils:

- **Flood damage** - Requires separate flood insurance
- **Earthquake damage** - Rare in Florida but excluded
- **Maintenance issues** - Neglect and wear-and-tear
- **Intentional damage** - Self-inflicted damage
- **Certain dog breeds** - Some carriers exclude specific breeds

### Understanding Hurricane Deductibles

Florida homeowners policies have separate deductibles for hurricane damage:

- **Percentage-based**: Typically 2-5% of your dwelling coverage
- **Example**: On a $400,000 home with a 2% hurricane deductible, you'd pay $8,000 out of pocket before coverage kicks in

Hurricane deductibles only apply when the National Weather Service names a hurricane. For other wind events, your regular deductible applies.

### Wind Mitigation: Save Money on Premiums

Florida law requires insurers to offer discounts for hurricane-resistant features. A wind mitigation inspection documents:

- Roof shape and covering
- Roof deck attachment
- Roof-to-wall connections
- Opening protection (shutters, impact windows)
- Secondary water resistance

These discounts can save hundreds or even thousands annually. If you haven't had a wind mitigation inspection, schedule one.

### Tips for Finding Affordable Coverage

1. **Shop multiple carriers** - Rates vary significantly between companies
2. **Increase your deductible** - Higher deductibles mean lower premiums
3. **Bundle policies** - Combine home and auto for discounts
4. **Maintain your roof** - Roof age is a major rating factor
5. **Install protective devices** - Security systems and water leak detectors can earn discounts
6. **Work with an independent agent** - We can compare rates from multiple carriers

### The Florida Insurance Market

Florida's insurance market has faced challenges including:

- Carriers leaving the state
- Rate increases across the industry
- Roof age requirements tightening
- Increased reliance on Citizens (state insurer)

Despite these challenges, coverage is available. Working with an independent agent who understands the market can help you find options.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much homeowners insurance do I need?

Your dwelling coverage should reflect the cost to rebuild your home at current construction costs. This is usually different from your purchase price or tax assessment. We can help you estimate an appropriate amount.

### Is flood insurance included?

No. Flood damage is specifically excluded from all homeowners policies in Florida. You need a separate flood insurance policy, available through the NFIP or private insurers.

### How can I lower my premium?

Wind mitigation discounts, higher deductibles, security systems, bundling with auto, and maintaining your roof in good condition can all help reduce premiums. Shopping multiple carriers annually is also important.

### What if my roof is old?

Many carriers won't insure roofs over 15-20 years old. If your roof is aging, consider replacement before it becomes a coverage issue. Some carriers offer extended coverage for well-maintained older roofs.

## Get Ready for Hurricane Season

Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 through November 30, though storms can form outside this window. Now is the time to review your insurance coverage and make sure you're prepared.

### Before Hurricane Season: Insurance Review

#### Review Your Homeowners Policy

- **Dwelling coverage**: Does it reflect current rebuild costs?
- **Hurricane deductible**: Do you understand your percentage?
- **Personal property**: Is your coverage adequate?
- **Loss of use**: Will it cover temporary housing if needed?

#### Check Your Flood Insurance

- **Do you have it?** Homeowners policies exclude flood damage
- **Coverage limits**: Are they adequate for your property?
- **Waiting period**: New policies have a 30-day wait
- **Don't delay**: You can't buy coverage when a storm threatens

#### Consider Additional Coverage

- **Umbrella policy**: Extra liability protection
- **Valuable items**: Scheduled coverage for jewelry, art, collectibles
- **Flood insurance**: If you don't have it, consider it

### Understanding Your Hurricane Deductible

Florida hurricane deductibles are different from your regular deductible:

| Dwelling Value | 2% Deductible | 5% Deductible |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| $300,000 | $6,000 | $15,000 |
| $400,000 | $8,000 | $20,000 |
| $500,000 | $10,000 | $25,000 |

**Important**: Hurricane deductibles only apply when a named hurricane causes damage. For tropical storms or other wind events, your regular deductible applies.

### Document Your Property

Before a storm threatens:

1. **Video walkthrough**: Record every room, closets, garage
2. **Photos of valuables**: Document serial numbers when possible
3. **Receipts and appraisals**: Store copies off-site or in cloud
4. **Home inventory app**: Consider using one to organize everything
5. **Store safely**: Keep documentation in waterproof container or cloud

### If a Hurricane Threatens

**Before the Storm:**
- Review your policy documents
- Know your insurance company's claims phone number
- Prepare to document any damage
- Protect your property (board windows, secure outdoor items)

**After the Storm:**
- Document all damage with photos and video immediately
- Prevent further damage if safely possible (tarping roof, etc.)
- Don't throw away damaged items until adjuster sees them
- Contact your insurance company promptly
- Keep receipts for temporary repairs and living expenses

### Filing a Hurricane Claim

1. **Report promptly**: Call your insurer as soon as safely possible
2. **Document everything**: Photos, video, written descriptions
3. **Make temporary repairs**: Prevent further damage, keep receipts
4. **Keep damaged items**: Don't dispose until adjuster approves
5. **Get multiple contractor estimates**: Don't rush into repairs
6. **Review settlement carefully**: Make sure it's adequate before accepting

### Common Hurricane Claim Mistakes

- Waiting too long to report damage
- Not documenting damage immediately
- Throwing away damaged items
- Making permanent repairs before adjuster visit
- Accepting first settlement without review
- Not understanding what's covered vs. excluded

### Wind vs. Flood: Know the Difference

**Wind damage** (covered by homeowners):
- Roof damage from wind
- Broken windows from debris
- Structural damage from wind pressure
- Rain entering through wind-caused openings

**Flood damage** (requires separate flood policy):
- Storm surge
- Rising water from any source
- Mudflow
- Water entering from ground level

During hurricanes, you may have both types of damage. If you have both policies, you may file claims with both insurers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When is hurricane season?

Atlantic hurricane season runs June 1 through November 30, with peak activity typically August through October.

### Can I buy flood insurance during hurricane season?

You can purchase anytime, but there's typically a 30-day waiting period before coverage begins. You cannot purchase when a storm is threatening.

### What if I disagree with my claim settlement?

You have options including requesting re-inspection, hiring a public adjuster, or consulting with an attorney. Contact us if you need guidance.

### Does my homeowners policy cover my car?

No. Vehicle damage from hurricanes is covered by your auto insurance's comprehensive coverage, not your homeowners policy.

## What Is a Wind Mitigation Inspection?

A wind mitigation inspection is a detailed assessment of your home's ability to withstand hurricane-force winds. Florida law requires insurance companies to offer premium discounts for homes with hurricane-resistant features.

The inspection documents specific construction features that reduce wind damage risk, and the resulting discounts can be substantial—often saving homeowners hundreds or even thousands of dollars annually.

### What Does the Inspector Look For?

Wind mitigation inspectors evaluate seven key areas:

#### 1. Roof Covering
- **Age of roof**: When was it installed?
- **Type of covering**: Shingles, tile, metal?
- **FBC (Florida Building Code) compliance**: Was it installed to current codes?

#### 2. Roof Deck Attachment
How is your roof deck (plywood/OSB) attached to the trusses?
- **Staples**: Minimal credit
- **6d nails**: Some credit
- **8d nails (6" spacing)**: Better credit
- **8d nails (4" spacing)**: Best credit

#### 3. Roof-to-Wall Attachment
How is your roof connected to the walls?
- **Toe nails**: Minimal credit
- **Clips**: Moderate credit
- **Single wraps**: Good credit
- **Double wraps**: Best credit

#### 4. Roof Geometry
- **Hip roof**: Best credit (slopes on all four sides)
- **Gable roof**: Less credit (vertical ends)
- **Flat roof**: Varies

Hip roofs perform better in hurricanes because wind flows over them rather than catching flat surfaces.

#### 5. Secondary Water Resistance (SWR)
If your roof covering blows off, is there a secondary barrier?
- **Sealed roof deck**: Significant credit
- **Self-adhering modified bitumen**: Significant credit
- **No SWR**: No credit for this feature

#### 6. Opening Protection
Are your windows, doors, and garage doors protected?
- **Hurricane shutters**: Good credit
- **Impact-resistant windows/doors**: Best credit
- **No protection**: No credit

All openings must be protected to receive credit.

#### 7. Garage Door
- **Wind-rated garage door**: Credit available
- **Standard garage door**: No credit

Garage doors are often the weakest point in homes during hurricanes.

### How Much Can You Save?

Savings vary based on your home and insurer, but examples include:

| Feature | Potential Annual Savings |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Hip roof | $200-500 |
| Hurricane shutters (all openings) | $300-800 |
| Roof-to-wall clips/straps | $200-600 |
| Secondary water resistance | $100-400 |
| Overall (multiple features) | $500-2,000+ |

Homes built after 2002 to the Florida Building Code often have many of these features built-in.

### How to Get a Wind Mitigation Inspection

1. **Find a qualified inspector**: Must be licensed Florida home inspector, general contractor, architect, or engineer
2. **Schedule the inspection**: Usually takes 30-60 minutes
3. **Provide access**: Inspector needs to see attic/roof structure
4. **Receive your report**: OIR-B1-1802 form
5. **Submit to insurer**: Your agent can help

#### Inspection Costs

Wind mitigation inspections typically cost $75-150. Given potential savings of hundreds or thousands annually, the return on investment is excellent.

### Maximizing Your Discounts

**Already have good features?**
Make sure you've had a recent inspection. If your last inspection is more than 5 years old, consider a new one—especially if you've made improvements.

**Want to improve your discounts?**
Consider these upgrades:
- Installing hurricane shutters or impact windows
- Reinforcing garage doors
- Adding roof straps (during re-roofing)
- Adding secondary water resistance (during re-roofing)

### Common Questions

**How often do I need an inspection?**
Inspections don't expire automatically, but insurers may require a new one after 5 years or if you make changes. A new roof always warrants a new inspection.

**Do all insurers accept wind mitigation discounts?**
Yes—Florida law requires it. However, the discount amounts vary by insurer.

**My home was built after 2002. Do I still need an inspection?**
Yes. While newer homes often have good features, you need documentation (the OIR form) to receive discounts.

**What if my home doesn't have any wind mitigation features?**
You won't receive discounts, but you won't be penalized either. Consider upgrades that provide both protection and premium savings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is a wind mitigation inspection the same as a home inspection?

No. A wind mitigation inspection focuses specifically on hurricane-resistant features. A standard home inspection covers general condition but doesn't generate the OIR form needed for insurance discounts.

### Can I do my own wind mitigation inspection?

No. The form must be completed by a licensed Florida professional—home inspector, general contractor, architect, or engineer.

### How long does the inspection take?

Typically 30-60 minutes. The inspector needs attic access to view roof structure and connections.

### When should I get a wind mitigation inspection?

When you first purchase insurance, after any roof work, when switching insurers, or if you haven't had one in 5+ years.
