## What Is the Progressive Insurance Florida Rebate?

**Quick Answer:** Progressive Insurance is returning nearly $1 billion to approximately 2.7 million Florida auto insurance policyholders in early 2026. This rebate is required by Florida law because Progressive's profits exceeded the state's statutory limits over the 2023-2025 period. The average policyholder will receive approximately $300 as a credit toward future premiums, with the exact amount based on how much you paid in premiums during 2025.

## How Much Will I Get from the Progressive Rebate?

**Quick Answer:** The average Progressive policyholder in Florida will receive approximately $300. However, your specific rebate amount will vary based on your policy's cost during calendar year 2025. Customers who paid higher premiums will receive larger credits, while those with lower-cost policies will receive proportionally smaller amounts. Progressive reported a $950 million policyholder credit expense in their Q3 2025 earnings specifically for this Florida rebate.

---

## When Will I Receive My Progressive Rebate?

**Quick Answer:** Progressive plans to distribute the rebates as credits to policyholders in early 2026. The credits will be applied automatically to your account and can be used toward future insurance purchases or renewals. You do not need to apply or take any action — the rebate will be issued automatically to all eligible Progressive policyholders in Florida who had active coverage as of December 31, 2025.

---

## Do I Qualify for the Progressive Florida Rebate?

**Quick Answer:** You qualify if you were one of Progressive's 2.7 million personal auto policyholders with active coverage in Florida as of December 31, 2025. The rebate applies to personal auto policies only — commercial policies are not included. If you had Progressive auto insurance in Florida during 2025, you should automatically receive a credit without needing to take any action.

## Why Is Progressive Giving Rebates to Florida Customers?

**Quick Answer:** Florida law requires auto insurers to return excess profits if their underwriting gains exceed anticipated profit plus 5% of earned premium over any three-year period. Progressive exceeded this limit during the 2023-2025 period, earning strong profits due to lower-than-expected claims following Florida's 2022-2023 insurance reforms (HB 837 and SB 2A). These reforms reduced lawsuit abuse and litigation costs, which improved Progressive's profitability beyond what the law allows them to keep.

**Key factors:**
1. Florida's tort reforms reduced insurance litigation by 23% year-over-year
2. Auto glass repair lawsuits dropped from 24,720 to 2,613 (89% reduction)
3. Progressive's loss ratio improved significantly

## Are Other Insurance Companies Also Lowering Rates?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, Florida's top auto insurers are all reducing rates in 2025-2026. According to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, GEICO filed a 10.5% decrease, State Farm filed a 10.1% decrease (with cumulative reductions of 20%), AAA has lowered rates by 15%, and USAA filed a 7% decrease. Florida's top five auto insurance groups averaged a 6.5% rate reduction in 2025, down from a 4.3% increase in 2024 and a 31.7% increase in 2023.

## How Does This Affect North Florida Drivers?

**Quick Answer:** North Florida drivers, including those in Lake City, Live Oak, Jasper, and Columbia County, benefit equally from these statewide rate reductions and rebates. If you have Progressive auto insurance, you'll receive the same rebate as policyholders elsewhere in Florida. Additionally, with multiple carriers reducing rates, North Florida residents now have more competitive options when shopping for auto coverage. This is an excellent time for Lake City area drivers to compare quotes and potentially save hundreds on their annual premiums.
