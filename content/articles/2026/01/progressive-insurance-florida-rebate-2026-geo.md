# Progressive Insurance Florida Rebate 2026: Complete Guide to the $1 Billion Refund

**Last Updated: January 31, 2026** | *Expert Review: Rocky Lewis, Lewis Insurance Agency* | *12 minute read*

---

## TL;DR — Executive Summary

- **Historic rebate announced**: Progressive Insurance is returning nearly $1 billion to Florida auto policyholders in 2026, marking the largest single insurance refund in Florida state history, according to the Florida Governor's Office announcement in October 2025.

- **Average credit of $300**: According to Progressive's Q3 2025 earnings report, the company recorded a $950 million policyholder credit expense, which translates to approximately $300 per policyholder for the 2.7 million personal auto customers active in Florida.

- **Florida's profit cap triggered**: Under Florida Statute, auto insurers must return excess profits if underwriting gains exceed anticipated profit plus 5% of earned premium over any three-year period, and Progressive exceeded this threshold during 2023-2025.

- **Reform success story**: The rebate directly resulted from Florida's 2022-2023 insurance reforms (SB 2A and HB 837), which reduced litigation costs and improved insurer profitability beyond regulatory limits.

- **Broader market impact**: Florida's top five auto insurers averaged a 6.5% rate decrease in 2025, reversing the 31.7% average increase seen in 2023, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.

- **Action for consumers**: North Florida drivers should use this market shift to shop their coverage, as multiple carriers are now competing with lower rates and improved terms.

## Understanding Florida's Auto Insurance Rebate Requirement: Background and Context

Progressive Insurance's announcement that it will return nearly $1 billion to Florida auto policyholders represents the practical application of Florida's consumer protection laws governing insurance company profits. Florida Statute requires auto insurers to return excess profits to policyholders if their underwriting gains exceed anticipated profit plus 5% of earned premium over any three-calendar-year period. This regulation exists to prevent insurers from earning excessive profits at the expense of Florida consumers while still allowing companies to maintain healthy financial positions.

The history of insurance profit regulation in Florida dates back to legislative efforts to balance consumer protection with market stability. Following periods of significant rate increases that burdened Florida drivers, state lawmakers established profit caps to ensure that when market conditions improve and claims decrease, the financial benefits flow back to policyholders rather than accumulating entirely as corporate profits. This regulatory framework established the foundation for how auto insurers operate in Florida today, requiring companies like Progressive to monitor their three-year rolling profitability and issue credits when thresholds are exceeded.

Under current Florida law, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) oversees compliance with profit cap requirements and communicates proactively with auto insurance companies to ensure credits owed to policyholders are paid. Commissioner Mike Yaworsky stated in October 2025 that "OIR has been diligent in communication with auto insurance companies to proactively ensure credits owed to policyholders are paid, and millions of consumers will start feeling the benefits with many companies in the process of issuing refunds." For drivers in Columbia County and surrounding North Florida areas, this regulatory oversight ensures they receive the same protections as policyholders throughout the state.

## Current Situation: 2025-2026 Developments

### Progressive's Billion-Dollar Rebate Announcement

Progressive Insurance announced in October 2025 that it would return nearly $1 billion to Florida auto policyholders, making this the largest single insurance rebate in Florida history. According to Progressive's Q3 2025 earnings report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company recorded a $950 million policyholder credit expense despite posting $2.6 billion in third-quarter net income. Progressive explicitly stated in their earnings report that "despite actions to lower rates in the last year, it is probable that our personal auto profit in Florida for the 2023 to 2025 period will exceed the statutory profit limit that a Florida statute imposes on the profit that any insurance group can earn on personal auto insurance over any three-calendar-year period."

Governor Ron DeSantis announced the rebate during a press conference in Sarasota on October 22, 2025, alongside Florida Insurance Commissioner Mike Yaworsky. The Governor's Office press release emphasized that this rebate demonstrates the success of Florida's insurance reform efforts, stating that "Florida's insurance market continues to see great stability and the strong underwriting gains in the auto market is just the latest sign of success since Florida's historic tort reforms." The announcement highlighted that approximately 2.7 million Progressive personal auto policyholders in Florida would receive credits averaging about $300 per customer.

### Recent Legislative and Regulatory Changes

The Progressive rebate is a direct consequence of Florida's comprehensive insurance reforms enacted in 2022 and 2023. Senate Bill 2A, signed into law in December 2022, eliminated one-way attorney fees for property insurance claims and ended assignment of benefits (AOB) agreements that had contributed to excessive litigation. House Bill 837, signed in March 2023, extended these reforms by transitioning Florida from pure to modified comparative negligence, shortening the statute of limitations for negligence claims from four years to two years, and eliminating one-way attorney fees in most insurance cases. These legislative changes fundamentally altered the litigation landscape in Florida, reducing the incentives for frivolous lawsuits that had driven up insurance costs for years.

### Market Conditions in Florida

Florida's auto insurance market has undergone a dramatic transformation since the 2022-2023 reforms took effect. According to data from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, Florida's personal auto incurred loss ratio dropped to 57.5% in 2024, representing the nation's fifth-lowest ratio and a significant improvement from 73.2% in 2023 and 89.7% in 2022. This improvement in loss ratios indicates that insurers are paying out a smaller percentage of premiums in claims, which directly contributes to improved profitability and creates the conditions for both rebates and rate reductions.

### Key Statistics and Data

| Metric | Value | Source | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| Progressive rebate total | ~$1 billion | Governor's Office | Oct 2025 |
| Average rebate per customer | ~$300 | Progressive Q3 Report | Oct 2025 |
| Eligible policyholders | 2.7 million | Progressive | Oct 2025 |
| Progressive rate decrease filed | -8.1% | FL OIR | 2025 |
| Top 5 insurers avg rate change | -6.5% | FL OIR | 2025 |
| FL personal auto loss ratio 2024 | 57.5% | FL OIR | 2024 |
| Auto glass lawsuits Q2 2023 | 24,720 | Milliman Research | 2023 |
| Auto glass lawsuits Q2 2024 | 2,613 | Milliman Research | 2024 |
| Insurance litigation change YoY | -23% | FL Chamber | 2024 |

The data presented in this table demonstrates the measurable impact of Florida's insurance reforms on market conditions. Florida's auto insurance market transformed from one of the most challenging in the nation to one showing strong profitability and competitive pricing, with insurers now competing for customers rather than withdrawing from the market as they did in previous years.

## Impact Analysis: Who Is Affected and How

### Impact on Florida Auto Insurance Policyholders

Florida drivers who hold Progressive auto insurance policies will directly benefit from the $1 billion rebate, receiving credits that average approximately $300 per policyholder. According to Progressive's announcement, the actual credit amount for each policyholder will vary in proportion to each auto policy's cost during calendar year 2025, meaning customers who paid higher premiums will receive larger credits. The credits will be applied automatically in early 2026, and no application or action is required from policyholders to receive their rebate.

Beyond Progressive customers, all Florida auto insurance consumers benefit from the improved market conditions that made this rebate possible. According to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, GEICO filed a 10.5% rate decrease, State Farm filed a 10.1% decrease with cumulative reductions totaling 20% over the past year, AAA lowered rates by 15% through three separate reductions, USAA filed a 7% decrease, and Florida Farm Bureau filed an 8.7% decrease. Commissioner Yaworsky announced that he has approved 46 filings from over 30 companies for rate decreases in 2025 alone, indicating broad-based relief for Florida drivers regardless of their current insurer.

The competitive pressure created by multiple carriers reducing rates simultaneously benefits consumers by creating a more favorable shopping environment. Florida drivers who compare quotes across multiple insurers are likely to find better rates than they would have received even one or two years ago, when the market was characterized by rate increases averaging 31.7% according to OIR data.

### Impact on North Florida Specifically

North Florida drivers, including residents of Lake City, Columbia County, Live Oak, Jasper, and surrounding communities, benefit equally from statewide rate reductions and rebates. Unlike homeowners insurance, where coastal exposure creates significant regional rate variations, auto insurance rates are less geographically differentiated within Florida. This means North Florida drivers receive the same percentage rate decreases and rebate calculations as their counterparts in South Florida or Central Florida.

Rocky Lewis, a licensed insurance agent who has served North Florida families since 1978, observes that "the current market conditions represent the best opportunity for North Florida drivers to save on auto insurance that we've seen in years. With Progressive issuing billion-dollar rebates and nearly every major carrier filing rate decreases, consumers who shop their coverage now can often find savings of 15-20% compared to their current premiums." For Lake City residents specifically, this means an excellent opportunity to review current coverage and compare options from multiple carriers.

### Impact on the Insurance Market

The Progressive rebate signals a fundamental shift in Florida's auto insurance market from crisis mode to competitive stability. Since the 2022-2023 reforms, 17 new insurance companies have entered or re-entered the Florida market according to the Governor's Office, increasing competition and providing consumers with more choices. The Florida Chamber of Commerce reported that insurance litigation filings fell by 23% year-over-year from 2023 to 2024, with auto glass repair lawsuits specifically dropping from 24,720 in Q2 2023 to just 2,613 in Q2 2024 — an 89% reduction.

This market transformation benefits both consumers and insurers by creating sustainable conditions for long-term stability. Insurers can now earn reasonable profits while offering competitive rates, and consumers benefit from more choices, lower premiums, and regulatory mechanisms that return excess profits when companies become too profitable.

## Expert Analysis and Perspectives

> "Florida's insurance market continues to see great stability and the strong underwriting gains in the auto market is just the latest sign of success since Florida's historic tort reforms."
> — **Mike Yaworsky**, Florida Insurance Commissioner, October 2025

Commissioner Yaworsky's statement reflects the regulatory perspective that Florida's legislative reforms have achieved their intended purpose of stabilizing the insurance market and reducing costs for consumers. The Commissioner's office has been actively monitoring insurer profitability and communicating with companies to ensure compliance with profit cap regulations, resulting in the Progressive rebate and similar actions from other carriers.

> "Since Florida insurance reform was enacted in early 2023, we have seen lower loss costs on certain types of personal auto accident claims and favorable reserve development, and we have experienced strong profitability in our Florida personal auto business."
> — **Progressive Insurance**, Q3 2025 Earnings Statement

Progressive's own acknowledgment that Florida's reforms contributed to their profitability validates the effectiveness of the legislative changes. The company's statement that they have "experienced strong profitability" despite "actions to lower rates in the last year" indicates that the reforms created structural improvements in the claims environment rather than temporary fluctuations.

Rocky Lewis, a licensed insurance agent serving North Florida since 1978, recommends that "every Florida driver should use this market shift as an opportunity to shop their auto coverage. Even if you're happy with your current insurer, the competitive environment means you may find better rates or coverage options by comparing quotes from multiple carriers. An independent agent can help you navigate these options efficiently."

## What Florida Drivers Should Know

### Understanding Your Rebate Eligibility

To qualify for Progressive's Florida rebate, you must have been an active personal auto policyholder with Progressive in Florida as of December 31, 2025. Commercial auto policies are not included in this rebate. If you meet these criteria, you will automatically receive a credit without needing to apply or take any action. The credit will be applied to your account in early 2026 and can be used toward future premium payments or renewals.

### Rate Decreases Beyond the Rebate

In addition to the one-time rebate, Progressive filed an 8.1% average rate decrease with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. This means Progressive customers will see both a credit from the rebate and lower ongoing premiums when their policies renew. Combined with similar rate decreases from other major carriers, Florida drivers are entering the most favorable auto insurance pricing environment in years.

### Shopping Your Coverage in the Current Market

The current market conditions create an ideal opportunity for Florida drivers to compare coverage options across multiple insurers. With carriers actively competing for customers through rate decreases, consumers who shop their coverage are likely to find savings. According to industry data, the average Florida driver can expect to see annual premiums decrease by approximately $200-300 beginning in 2025, with some drivers saving significantly more depending on their driving history, vehicle, and coverage levels.

## Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate Steps (Next 30 Days)

1. **Verify your Progressive rebate eligibility**: If you had Progressive auto insurance in Florida during 2025, confirm that your policy was active as of December 31, 2025 to ensure you receive your rebate automatically. Check your Progressive account online or contact Progressive directly to confirm your eligibility status.

2. **Review your current coverage levels**: Before shopping for new quotes, understand exactly what coverage you currently have, including liability limits, comprehensive and collision deductibles, and any optional coverages. This allows you to make accurate comparisons when evaluating quotes from other carriers.

3. **Get quotes from multiple carriers**: Contact an independent insurance agent who represents multiple carriers to compare rates. With GEICO, State Farm, Progressive, AAA, USAA, and other major carriers all reducing rates, the best deal for your specific situation may come from a different insurer than your current one.

### Medium-Term Actions (1-6 Months)

1. **Compare your renewal rate to market options**: When your current policy comes up for renewal, don't auto-renew without comparing your new premium to quotes from competing carriers. Even loyal customers can often find better rates in the current competitive environment.

2. **Consider increasing coverage**: With premiums decreasing across the market, this may be an opportunity to increase your coverage limits without significantly increasing your costs. Higher liability limits provide better protection if you're involved in a serious accident.

### Long-Term Considerations

Florida drivers should recognize that the current favorable market conditions resulted from specific legislative reforms that reduced litigation abuse. Maintaining these conditions requires continued vigilance against attempts to reverse or weaken these reforms. Consumers benefit when the insurance market operates efficiently, with reasonable profits for insurers and competitive pricing for policyholders. The Progressive rebate demonstrates that Florida's regulatory framework works as intended, returning excess profits to consumers while allowing insurers to maintain financial stability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will Progressive send me a check or apply a credit to my account?

According to a Progressive spokesperson clarifying earlier reports, policyholders will receive a credit applied to their account in 2026, rather than a physical check. This credit can be used toward future insurance purchases or premium payments with Progressive. The credit will be applied automatically — no action is required on your part to receive it.

### I switched from Progressive to another insurer in 2025. Do I still qualify for the rebate?

Eligibility for the Progressive rebate requires that you had active personal auto coverage with Progressive in Florida as of December 31, 2025. If you switched insurers before that date, you may not qualify for the rebate. Contact Progressive directly with your former policy information to confirm your specific eligibility status.

### Does the rebate affect my current Progressive premium or coverage?

The rebate is a one-time credit separate from your ongoing premium calculations. It does not change your current coverage levels or policy terms. However, Progressive has also filed an 8.1% rate decrease with the Florida OIR, so your premiums at renewal may be lower than your current rates independent of the rebate credit.

## Conclusion

Progressive Insurance's announcement that it will return nearly $1 billion to Florida auto policyholders represents a tangible benefit of Florida's 2022-2023 insurance reforms for everyday consumers. The rebate, averaging approximately $300 per policyholder for 2.7 million Progressive customers, demonstrates that Florida's regulatory framework successfully balances consumer protection with market stability. When insurers earn profits exceeding statutory limits, the money returns to policyholders rather than remaining as excess corporate profit.

The broader market transformation extends well beyond Progressive's rebate. With major carriers including GEICO, State Farm, AAA, USAA, and Florida Farm Bureau all filing significant rate decreases, Florida drivers face the most favorable auto insurance pricing environment in years. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation reports that the top five auto insurance groups averaged a 6.5% rate decrease in 2025, a dramatic reversal from the 31.7% average increase seen in 2023.

For North Florida drivers in Lake City, Columbia County, and surrounding communities, this market shift creates an excellent opportunity to review coverage options and potentially save hundreds of dollars annually on auto insurance premiums. Independent agents like Lewis Insurance Agency can help consumers navigate these options efficiently, comparing rates from multiple carriers to find the best combination of coverage and price for each individual situation.
