## What Is PIP Insurance and Why Is It Ending?

**Quick Answer:** PIP (Personal Injury Protection) is Florida's current no-fault insurance that pays your medical bills regardless of who caused an accident. Florida is eliminating PIP on July 1, 2026, replacing it with a traditional at-fault system where the driver who causes an accident pays for others' injuries. This change follows years of reform efforts to reduce insurance fraud and lower premiums for Florida drivers.

---

## What Are the New Insurance Requirements Starting July 2026?

**Quick Answer:** Starting July 1, 2026, all Florida drivers must carry bodily injury liability coverage of at least $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident, plus $5,000 in medical payments (MedPay) coverage. Property damage liability remains at $10,000. You'll need to show proof of bodily injury coverage to register your vehicle.

**New Minimum Requirements:**
- $25,000 bodily injury per person
- $50,000 bodily injury per accident
- $5,000 medical payments (MedPay)
- $10,000 property damage (unchanged)

## How Will This Affect My Auto Insurance Premium?

**Quick Answer:** Most Florida drivers could save around $349 annually under the new system, according to recent studies. However, your actual premium change depends on your driving record, age, and location. Some North Florida drivers in Columbia County may see decreases, while drivers with poor records could pay more. Major insurers like State Farm, Progressive, and USAA have already filed for rate decreases of 7-10%.

---

## What Happens If I'm in an Accident After July 1, 2026?

**Quick Answer:** Under the new at-fault system, the driver who caused the accident is financially responsible for the other party's injuries. Unlike PIP, you won't automatically have your medical bills covered by your own insurance. Your health insurance will need to cover medical expenses while fault is determined. If someone else caused the accident, you can sue them for damages.

---

## Do I Need Uninsured Motorist Coverage?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, absolutely. With approximately 16-20% of Florida drivers uninsured, UM/UIM coverage is more important than ever. If an uninsured driver hits you, your uninsured motorist coverage pays for your injuries since you can no longer rely on PIP. Lake City drivers and others in North Florida should strongly consider carrying UM/UIM limits that match their bodily injury limits.

---

## When Will My Policy Automatically Update?

**Quick Answer:** Insurance companies must notify policyholders about the PIP repeal by April 1, 2026. Your policy will automatically update to meet the new requirements at your next renewal after July 1, 2026. If your renewal is before July 1, contact your insurer about adding bodily injury coverage early.

**Timeline:**
1. April 1, 2026: Insurers notify policyholders of changes
2. July 1, 2026: New requirements take effect
3. At renewal: Policies update to new coverage structure

## What Should Lake City Drivers Do Now?

**Quick Answer:** North Florida drivers should review their current coverage and consider adding bodily injury liability before the July deadline. Many Lake City residents already carry BI coverage, but those with only PIP and property damage need to act. Contact Lewis Insurance to review your policy and ensure you're ready for the change.
