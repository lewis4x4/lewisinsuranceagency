When Florida repeals its no-fault PIP system and requires new 25/50/10 coverage limits starting July 1, 2026, will you know exactly how this affects your current auto policy? With Citizens Property Insurance dropping from 936,000 to 395,000 policies in 2025 and the state announcing an average 8.7% rate decrease for Citizens policyholders in Spring 2026, Florida's insurance landscape is shifting faster than most residents can follow. These aren't minor tweaks—they're fundamental changes that could save you thousands or leave you dangerously underinsured if you don't understand them.

Local independent agents like Lewis Insurance Agency exist specifically for moments like these. When auto insurance companies report an average -6.5% rate change and 17 new insurers enter the Florida market, North Florida residents need someone who understands both the regulatory changes and how they apply to Columbia County's unique risks. Unlike national carriers that treat Gainesville the same as Tallahassee, local agents know that Lake City's flood zones, wind patterns, and Claims history create specific coverage needs that require personalized attention.

Calling a 1-800 number when these new laws take effect means talking to someone in another state who learned about Florida regulations from a training manual. They can't explain why Florida shortened claim filing deadlines from two years to one, or how the elimination of one-way attorney fees might affect your claim experience. When your auto policy renews after July 2026, that call center representative won't understand why your PIP coverage disappeared or help you navigate the new bodily injury requirements that could dramatically change your protection.

Lewis Insurance Agency has spent 44+ years building relationships with multiple carriers who actively write business in North Florida. When carriers like Heritage, Patriot Select, and Security First file for rate decreases of up to 11.3%, we know which ones are financially stable and which coverage options work best for Columbia County properties. Our local knowledge means understanding that a home in Lake City faces different wind and water risks than properties in Miami-Dade, where premium reductions average 14% due to different litigation patterns.

Don't navigate Florida's insurance revolution alone. Call Lewis Insurance Agency at (386) 755-0050 or visit our Lake City office to discuss how these regulatory changes affect your specific situation. Our 44+ years of local experience means you'll get guidance tailored to North Florida's unique conditions, not generic advice from a national call center. With insurance laws changing this dramatically, now is the time to work with someone who truly understands both Florida regulations and your local community's needs.
