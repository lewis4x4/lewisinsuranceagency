Florida law only requires $10,000 in PIP and $10,000 in property damage liability. That might sound like enough until you realize a single trip to the ER can cost three times that amount, and a fender bender with a new truck can easily exceed your coverage limits.

Most online quote tools push you toward the cheapest option. That's great for their conversion rates, but it leaves you exposed when something actually happens. At Lewis Insurance Agency, we take a different approach. We ask about your daily commute, whether you have teenage drivers, what your vehicle is worth, and what assets you need to protect if someone sues you after an accident.

Since 1981, we've helped Florida drivers find the balance between affordable premiums and real protection. We work with multiple carriers, so we can show you options side by side—not just one company's take-it-or-leave-it quote. Need an SR-22? We handle those. Have a teen driver that's making your rates spike? We know which carriers are more forgiving. Drive for Uber or Lyft on the side? We'll make sure you're actually covered when the app is on.

The right auto insurance isn't about finding the lowest number. It's about knowing you're protected when it matters.
