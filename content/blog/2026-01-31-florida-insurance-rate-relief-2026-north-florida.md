# Florida Insurance Rate Relief 2026: What North Florida Homeowners Need to Know

After years of soaring premiums, carrier exits, and difficult renewals, Florida homeowners are finally getting good news. Governor Ron DeSantis announced in January 2026 that insurance reforms passed in 2022 and 2023 are delivering real results—and Citizens Insurance policyholders will see their first rate decrease since 2015.

For homeowners in North Florida—from Jacksonville to Gainesville to Lake City and the surrounding counties—this represents a meaningful shift in a market that has tested everyone's patience and budgets. Here's what you need to know about the changes and how to make the most of them.

## What's Happening: The Rate Reductions Explained

Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, Florida's state-backed insurer of last resort, has approved an **average rate reduction of 8.7%** for personal lines policyholders. This is the first decrease since 2015—a decade of rate increases finally reversed.

The impact is substantial:

- **More than 330,000 policyholders** across all 67 Florida counties will see premium decreases
- **Over 150,000 policyholders** will receive reductions of 10% or greater
- South Florida sees the largest cuts (Broward County averaging 14.1%), but North Florida benefits too

**When will you see the savings?** Rate reductions take effect at your policy renewal starting in **Spring 2026**. If your renewal is in April or later, you should see the new rates reflected.

Private carriers are following suit. Recent filings show:
- **Florida Peninsula**: 8.2% decrease
- **Security First**: 8% decrease
- **Universal Property & Casualty**: 5.1% decrease

Competition is returning to Florida, and that means better options for homeowners.

## Why Rates Are Finally Coming Down

The rate relief didn't happen by accident. It's the direct result of legislative reforms passed in late 2022 (SB 2A) and early 2023 (HB 837)—what many called the most significant property insurance reforms in Florida history.

### What the Reforms Changed

**Eliminated One-Way Attorney Fees**: Previously, if a policyholder sued their insurer and won even a small dispute, the insurer had to pay the policyholder's attorney fees. This created an incentive for litigation over minor claims. Now, fee arrangements are more balanced.

**Ended Assignment of Benefits (AOB) Abuse**: Contractors could previously have homeowners sign over their insurance benefits, then inflate claims and sue insurers directly. This practice drove up costs for everyone. The reforms eliminated AOBs for property claims.

### The Results Speak for Themselves

Before the reforms, Florida accounted for just 8% of homeowners insurance claims nationally—but **76% of all homeowners insurance litigation**. That imbalance is now correcting:

- Litigation between plaintiffs and insurers has dropped dramatically
- Florida's ranking for "nuclear verdicts" (massive jury awards) fell from 2nd nationally to 10th
- The Florida property-casualty industry posted its **first profitable year since 2016** in 2023
- **17 new insurance companies** have entered or re-entered the Florida market

More competition means better rates and more choices for homeowners.

## What This Means for Citizens Policyholders

If you currently have a Citizens policy, there are several things to understand about what's ahead.

### You'll See Rate Relief at Renewal

Starting Spring 2026, your renewal premium should reflect the 8.7% average decrease. The exact amount varies by location, home characteristics, and coverage levels—but the trend is finally moving in the right direction.

### The Flood Insurance Requirement Is Coming

Citizens has announced that **all policyholders must carry separate flood insurance by 2027**, regardless of whether they're in a designated flood zone. This is part of Citizens' solvency planning.

If you don't currently have flood insurance, start budgeting for it now. [Flood insurance](/blog/understanding-flood-insurance-florida) costs vary but typically run $400-$1,500 annually for most North Florida homes.

### You May Have Private Market Options Now

Citizens was designed as a last resort—for homeowners who couldn't find coverage in the private market. With 17 new carriers and improving market conditions, you may now qualify for private coverage that wasn't available before.

Private insurers often offer:
- Broader coverage options
- Better claims service
- Replacement cost coverage (vs. actual cash value)
- No flood insurance mandate (though you should still carry it)

An independent agent can check whether you have private market options. Given that **546,000+ policies** moved from Citizens to private insurers in 2024 alone, there's a good chance you do.

## What This Means for Private Insurance Customers

If you're already with a private carrier, you're also positioned to benefit from the improving market.

### Competition Is Increasing

With more carriers writing in Florida, you have more options. This is a good time to shop your renewal—even if your current carrier isn't raising rates, another carrier may offer a better price or better coverage.

### Rate Stabilization Across the Market

The reforms don't just help Citizens—they've stabilized the entire Florida market. Average rate increases across all insurers dropped from **21% in 2023** to a projected **0.2% in 2025**. That's essentially flat, a dramatic improvement from the double-digit increases homeowners faced in recent years.

### Shop Before You Renew

Even satisfied customers should get comparative quotes every 2-3 years. Market conditions change, and carriers price risk differently. Working with an independent agent who represents multiple carriers is the most efficient way to compare options.

## How North Florida Homeowners Can Take Action

Here's how to make the most of the improving insurance market:

### 1. Review Your Policy at Renewal

Don't just auto-pay your renewal. Review the declaration page and understand:
- Your dwelling coverage (is it adequate for current rebuild costs?)
- Your hurricane deductible percentage
- What's included vs. excluded

### 2. Get Quotes from Multiple Carriers

An independent agent can quote you with multiple companies in one conversation. We work with carriers across the market and can identify which ones are most competitive for your specific situation.

### 3. Consider a Wind Mitigation Inspection

If you haven't had a [wind mitigation inspection](/blog/wind-mitigation-inspection-guide), now is a great time. These inspections document hurricane-resistant features in your home and can save hundreds annually. Combined with the market-wide rate decreases, you could see significant savings.

### 4. Don't Forget Flood Insurance

Whether Citizens requires it or not, every Florida homeowner should consider flood coverage. Standard homeowners policies exclude flood damage completely. One inch of floodwater causes approximately $25,000 in damage—and 25% of flood claims come from properties outside high-risk zones.

### 5. Work with a Local Independent Agent

Market conditions vary by county and carrier. A local agent understands which carriers are writing in your area, which ones have the best rates for your home's characteristics, and how to maximize discounts. We've been helping North Florida homeowners navigate this market since 1981.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will I see the rate decrease on my policy?

Rate changes take effect at policy renewal. If your Citizens policy renews in Spring 2026 or later, you should see the new rates. Private carrier timing varies—ask your agent when your carrier's rate changes become effective.

### Does everyone get a rate decrease?

The 8.7% is a statewide average for Citizens. Most policyholders will see decreases, but some may see smaller reductions or stable rates depending on their specific risk profile. Private carriers vary in their filings.

### Should I leave Citizens for a private carrier?

It depends on your situation. Private carriers may offer better coverage or pricing—but not always. Have an independent agent compare your options. If private coverage is comparable or better, it's generally advisable to move to the private market.

### Will rates continue to decrease?

Market conditions are improving, but no one can guarantee future rates. Hurricane seasons, inflation in construction costs, and other factors affect pricing. The best strategy is to review your coverage annually and compare options.

### What if my roof is older—can I still get coverage?

Roof age remains a significant factor. Some carriers won't write homes with roofs over 15-20 years old. However, the improving market means more carriers are writing, and some offer options for well-maintained older roofs. If you're having trouble finding coverage, contact us—we can help identify carriers that may work with your situation.

For North Florida homeowners, this is an opportunity to review your coverage, shop your options, and potentially save money while improving your protection. Don't let your renewal auto-pay without checking what's available.
