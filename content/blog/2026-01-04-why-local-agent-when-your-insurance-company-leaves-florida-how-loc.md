Picture this: You open your mailbox to find a letter from your insurance company with devastating news—they're no longer writing policies in Florida. You have 120 days to find new coverage, and you're already hearing horror stories from neighbors who can't find affordable options. Many homeowners have lost their insurance and been forced to find coverage elsewhere, often with state-back Citizens Property Insurance. What seemed like a distant problem for other people just became your reality.

This scenario plays out thousands of times across Florida every year. Farmers Insurance, Nationwide, and Progressive have all announced major changes to their presence in the Florida market. Insurance companies that have left Florida or reduced their exposure in the area include Farmers, Progressive, and AAA. When carriers abandon the state due to Florida accounting for just 9% of the nation's home insurance claims while making up 79% of related lawsuits, local independent agents become your lifeline to coverage.

Buying direct from a carrier's website or calling a 1-800 number leaves you stranded when that company exits Florida. You're just a policy number in a database, and when they pull out, you're on your own to navigate a complex market. Online platforms can't explain why State Farm stopped writing new policies in North Florida or help you understand which carriers are still actively writing in Columbia County. They certainly can't advocate for you when coverage becomes scarce.

Lewis Insurance Agency has weathered 44+ years of Florida's insurance storms, including the current crisis that has Citizens ending 2025 with about 385,000 policies as new carriers moved into the rejuvenated state arena. When major insurers announced their Florida departures, our established relationships with multiple carriers meant our clients had options while others scrambled. We maintain appointments with both national carriers still writing in Florida and regional companies that understand North Florida's unique risks. Our decades of local knowledge help us match Lake City area families with carriers that aren't just available today, but positioned to stay in the Florida market long-term.

Don't wait for the cancellation notice to find out your carrier is pulling back from Florida. The insurance landscape is shifting, and 2025 data shows the property insurance market is the healthiest it's been in five years with more normality in the industry. Lewis Insurance Agency can review your current coverage and ensure you're with a stable carrier committed to Florida's future. Call us at (386) 755-0050 or visit our website to schedule a consultation—because when the insurance market gets turbulent, having a local advocate makes all the difference.
