# Florida Wind Mitigation Savings: Your Complete Guide to Insurance Discounts in 2026

Florida homeowners know the drill: hurricane season brings worry, and insurance premiums bring sticker shock. But here's the good news – Florida homeowners may save between 3% and 55% on the windstorm portion of their policy through wind mitigation inspections. With the Florida Legislature allocating $280 million for the 2025-2026 fiscal year to fund new Wind-Mitigation Inspections and Grants under the My Safe Florida Home program, there's never been a better time to explore these savings opportunities.

For Lake City residents and North Florida homeowners, understanding wind mitigation can mean the difference between sky-high premiums and manageable insurance costs. Let's dive into everything you need to know about maximizing your Florida wind mitigation savings in 2026.

## What Is Wind Mitigation and Why Does It Matter?

The State of Florida requires insurance companies to offer discounts for protecting your home against damage caused by windstorms. These discounts are known as wind mitigation credits. Wind mitigation credits are discounts on your homeowner's insurance premium given for features that make your home more resistant to wind damage.

Think of it this way: a home that can withstand high winds is less likely to suffer major damage during a hurricane, which means fewer costly claims for the insurer. Insurance companies reward this reduced risk with substantial premium discounts.

A wind mitigation inspection evaluates specific features of your home that help it resist hurricane-force winds. It looks for certain features on your property, such as roof covering, roof deck attachment, roof to wall connection/attachment, opening protection, roof shape/geometry, and secondary water resistance.

### The Financial Impact

The savings can be dramatic. For a Tampa home with a $3,000 annual premium, that could mean anywhere from $150 to more than $1,500 in yearly savings. According to the MSFH website, participants have saved an average of $1,014 annually on insurance premiums – a significant win in Florida's costly insurance market.

For North Florida homeowners, these savings are particularly valuable given the region's hurricane exposure and rising insurance costs.

## Florida's Updated Wind Mitigation Requirements for 2026

Section 627.0629, Florida Statutes, requires OIR, by January 1, 2025, and every 5 years after that, to review and update the fixtures or construction techniques demonstrated to reduce windstorm damage, along with the related insurance discounts and deductible reductions reflecting the value of such efforts. This means the wind mitigation landscape continues to evolve with new requirements and opportunities for savings.

The Uniform Mitigation Verification Inspection Form (OIR-B1-1802) is valid for up to five (5) years provided no material changes are made to the structure or inaccuracies are found on the form.

### Key Wind Mitigation Features Evaluated

Your wind mitigation inspection will focus on these critical areas:

**Roof Shape and Construction**: A hip roof for example resembles a pyramid, and definitely qualifies for an insurance discount. Hip roofs perform better in high winds compared to gable roofs.

**Roof Deck Attachment**: The roof deck attachment connects the roof deck to the trusses or rafters by various types of plywood and nails. Enhanced attachment methods can significantly reduce wind uplift.

**Roof-to-Wall Connection**: This examines how well your roof structure connects to the walls, including hurricane clips and straps.

**Opening Protection**: To qualify for the opening protection credit, all windows and openings must be protected by wind impact resistant glass.

**Secondary Water Resistance**: This is the underlying sealing on your roof before the roof tiles or shingles are nailed or glued down.

## How Much Can You Save? 2026 Discount Maximums

The potential savings vary significantly based on your home's features:

- Credits can go up to the maximum savings of 88% off the hurricane/wind premium.
- Policy credit (up to a maximum of 90% inclusive of any Building Code Effectiveness Grading discount) may be available to you.
- Florida insurance premium discounts, for certain favorable wind mitigation features, have been mandated by State law and produce significant savings of up to 45% off the original policy's premium.

### Real-World Examples

One homeowner reported a 14% insurance premium reduction ($714 annually) after installing impact windows with a $10,000 MSFH grant. In many cases, the inspection pays for itself in less than a year.

## The 2025-2026 My Safe Florida Home Program: Free Inspections and Grants

Thanks to a fresh $280 million funding boost in the 2025–2026 state budget, the My Safe Florida Home program is making a major comeback. This program offers incredible opportunities for North Florida homeowners:

### What the Program Offers

**Free Wind Mitigation Inspections**: The program offers free wind mitigation inspections and matching grants of up to $10,000 for hurricane-resistant upgrades like impact windows, doors, and storm shutters.

**Matching Grants**: Homeowners who receive the inspection may also apply for matching grant funds to help pay for any recommended improvements, with the state matching $2 for every dollar the homeowners spend, up to a cap of $10,000.

### Program Funding Breakdown

The new budget includes $94 million for My Safe Florida Home mitigation grants, $1.5 million for inspections, $4.7 million for administrative costs, and a nonrecurring sum of $180 million for the program moving forward for fiscal year 2025-2026.

### Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the My Safe Florida Home program, your property must meet these criteria:

- Be a single-family, detached house or a townhouse (attached single-family homes qualify as townhouses).
- The building permit of the home must have been issued before Jan. 1, 2008
- The homeowner must allow the home to be reinspected after the work is completed

The program prioritizes certain groups: In 2024, new grant applications were weighted toward residents ages 60 and older, and residents who qualify as low- or moderate-income, with a staggered application schedule giving them priority.

## Wind Mitigation Inspection Costs and Process

### Inspection Costs

According to home renovation expert Bob Vila, a wind mitigation inspection costs about $100 but can vary based on the area you live in Florida. Most inspections cost between $75 and $150, depending on location, roof size, and overall home features.

For less than $150, a Florida wind mitigation inspection could save you hundreds or even thousands every year on insurance premiums.

### Who Can Perform Inspections

Only certain Florida-certified construction professionals can perform a wind mitigation inspection, including:

- Home inspector licensed under Section 468.8314, Florida Statutes who has completed the statutory number of hours of hurricane mitigation training
- Building code inspector certified under Section 468.607, Florida Statues
- General, building, or residential contractor licensed under Section 489.111, Florida Statues
- Professional engineer licensed under Section 471.015, Florida Statues

### Finding Inspectors in North Florida

For Lake City and North Florida residents, High Mark Inspections provides wind mitigation insurance inspections in Columbia and Suwannee counties which includes Live Oak, Lake City, Fort White, High Springs, White Springs, and Branford Florida. This local option ensures you're working with inspectors familiar with the specific challenges and opportunities in our region.

## Special Considerations for Older and Newer Homes

### Homes Built After 2002

If your home was built after 2002—good news! You automatically receive default credits on your Progressive homeowners policy. But more discounts may be available to you.

Houses built after 2002 in the rest of the state have many wind resistive construction features and will likely qualify for credits due to enhanced building codes implemented after major hurricanes.

### Retrofitting Older Homes

If your home was built prior to 2002, you're not out of luck. You may still qualify for discounts if you have since installed mitigation features or construction techniques.

There are a few cost-effective measures you can take to safeguard your home and reduce your hurricane-wind premium: securing your roof with hurricane clips or wraps, for example, or hurricane protecting all windows, doors and other openings to your home.

## How Wind Mitigation Inspections Work

### The Inspection Process

The time needed to complete our inspections is usually about an hour, but that can also depend on the size of the property. During the inspection, certified professionals carefully identify and document specific features that protect your home against wind damage.

### What Inspectors Look For

The Florida Wind Mitigation, also referred to as the Florida Uniform Wind Mitigation Report, consists of a standard form with 7 questions. Each question provides an opportunity for homeowners to receive discounts on their insurance premiums based on specific features of their property. While there are no strict requirements or codes to meet, each question presents a potential discount for homeowners.

### Report Validity

Most wind mitigation inspections are good for five years. It's best to check with your agent to determine what they require after a home inspection expires.

The credits continue for the life of the insurance policy in which the inspection report was used to apply credits. However, the inspection report expires after five years, therefore if you change companies after five years of the inspection you will need to obtain a new wind mitigation report to submit to the new insurance carrier.

## Beyond Savings: Additional Benefits of Wind Mitigation

### Enhanced Storm Protection

It also strengthens your property against storm damage, helping you avoid costly repairs. These added protections provide peace of mind during Florida's hurricane season.

### Increased Home Value

A current report can even boost resale value, since buyers view wind-resistant features and reduced insurance costs as major advantages.

### Long-Term Financial Benefits

Wind mitigation delivers immediate and lasting value for virtually every Florida property owner. Beyond financial savings, it strengthens your home's defenses and helps minimize potential storm damage when the next hurricane hits.

## Taking Action: Your Next Steps

### 1. Assess Your Home's Current Features

Look at your roof shape, window protection, and construction date. Many homeowners may see enough discounts to cover the inspection cost within the first year (results vary by carrier, rating factors, and credits).
