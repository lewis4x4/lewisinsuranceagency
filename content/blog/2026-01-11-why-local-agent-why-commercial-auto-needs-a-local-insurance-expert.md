When Jacksonville contractor Mike Rodriguez clicked "buy now" on a commercial auto quote online, he thought he'd saved time and money. Three months later, when his work truck was involved in an accident on I-75, he discovered his policy didn't meet Florida's complex commercial vehicle requirements. With pending legislation set to increase minimum liability coverage from $10,000 per person to $25,000 per person by July 2026, Florida's commercial auto landscape has never been more complicated.

Florida ranks 48th in affordability, making it the third most expensive state for business vehicle insurance, with commercial auto costs ranging between $250 and $1,370 per month. Between North Florida's busy trucking corridors, hurricane risks, and litigation-happy claimants, business owners need someone who understands the local challenges. Fleet operators must ensure each vehicle is correctly registered and insured, update contractor insurance proof clauses, and prepare for mid-2026 liability threshold changes – requirements that vary drastically based on your industry and vehicle weight.

That 1-800 number might offer quick quotes, but when your delivery van breaks down during a Category 2 hurricane or your service truck is involved in a multi-vehicle accident on the Buckman Bridge, you'll be talking to someone in another time zone who's never driven Florida's roads. Online platforms excel at basic coverage but often miss critical details like specialized requirements for hazardous material transport requiring $1 million or more in coverage or the fact that Florida requires $125,000 in bodily injury liability per person for taxis and limousines – far above standard minimums.

Lewis Insurance Agency has navigated Florida's commercial auto requirements for over 44 years, through multiple regulatory changes and market upheavals. We understand that Lake City contractors face different challenges than Miami food truck operators, and we work with multiple carriers to find coverage that matches your specific needs and budget. When Florida's top five auto insurers reduced rates by an average of 6.5% in 2025 due to litigation reforms, our clients were among the first to benefit because we actively monitor rate changes and advocate for adjustments.

Don't let complex regulations and changing requirements catch you off guard. Call Lewis Insurance Agency at (386) 755-0050 or visit our office to discuss your commercial auto needs with someone who knows Florida's roads, regulations, and risks firsthand. We'll review your current coverage, explain upcoming changes, and ensure your business stays protected and compliant – because when your livelihood depends on the road, you need an expert who understands the journey.
