Picture this: You're settling into your Florida winter home when your Michigan insurance agent calls with bad news. Your seasonal policy won't renew because your North Florida roof is over 15 years old—something they didn't understand when selling you coverage. Now you're scrambling to find new insurance during peak snowbird season, competing with thousands of other seasonal residents for limited coverage.

This scenario isn't fiction—it's happening right now across Florida. Citizens Property Insurance Corporation's Board approved 2026 rate recommendations that reduce average rates for personal lines policyholders for the first time since 2015, with three out of five Citizens policyholders receiving an average premium reduction of 11.5%, or $359. But here's what your out-of-state agent might not tell you: seasonal residents may be required to shift their coverage from Citizens to a private company if the private carrier offers a rate 20% or lower than Citizens, and it's becoming harder for seasonal residents to maintain Citizens coverage if they're using it for vacation homes that aren't their primary residences.

When you buy insurance from a 1-800 number or online platform, you're getting generic advice from representatives who've never experienced Florida's unique challenges. They don't know that Florida's updated insurance law prevents insurers from dropping your policy based solely on roof age, as long as you can provide a professional inspection confirming the roof has at least 5 years of useful life remaining. They can't explain that Florida insurers often require a "caretaker" to check the property weekly to maintain coverage for seasonal use, or help you navigate the complexities of maintaining coverage on an empty property during hurricane season. These representatives change constantly, meaning you'll explain your snowbird situation to a different person every time you call.

Lewis Insurance Agency has been serving North Florida families for over 44 years, and we've watched thousands of snowbirds successfully navigate Florida's evolving insurance landscape. We understand that Citizens Property considers a standard shingle roof old if it's been in place for 25 years or longer, while slate, tile, clay, metal, or concrete roofs are considered old if they've been in place for 50 years or longer—distinctions that matter greatly for Lake City area properties. Our team knows which of our multiple carrier relationships work best for seasonal residents, and we can help you take advantage of Florida Peninsula Insurance's requested 8.4% decrease for homeowners' premiums and 12% reduction for condominium owners if you qualify.

Don't let this improving Florida insurance market pass you by while you're stuck with inadequate coverage from distant representatives. The Florida Insurance Market is on the upswing, presenting a fantastic opportunity for Florida homeowners to secure better coverage at competitive prices.
