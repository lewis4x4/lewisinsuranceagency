When Sarah Thompson received her Citizens Insurance takeout notice in Lake City last month, she had just 30 days to make a decision that could cost her hundreds of dollars annually. Like many North Florida homeowners, she discovered that navigating Florida's insurance laws isn't something you can figure out from a website or a 1-800-number call. With Citizens policies dropping from 936,182 at the start of 2025 to just 395,144 by the end of the year, thousands of Florida homeowners are facing similar complex situations that demand expert guidance.

Florida's insurance landscape has undergone dramatic changes following the 2022 legislative reforms, creating a maze of regulations that even seasoned homeowners find confusing. The state's "20% rule" makes customers ineligible to remain with Citizens if they receive offers from private insurers within 20% of Citizens' premiums, but understanding how this calculation works and what it means for your specific situation requires deep knowledge of Florida insurance law. In 2025 alone, more than 546,000 Citizens policies were transferred to private companies through the depopulation program, and 96.5% of takeout offers fell below the 20% threshold, meaning those homeowners were legally barred from staying with Citizens.

When you call a national carrier's customer service line or try to navigate these changes online, you're dealing with representatives who may not understand Florida's unique requirements. They can't explain why Central Florida counties like Orange, Osceola, and Lake are seeing rate increases while South Florida sees decreases, or how the takeout process actually works. Many don't realize that you cannot apply directly with Citizens – you must work through an authorized agent who understands the eligibility requirements. Without this local expertise, homeowners often miss critical deadlines, accept inappropriate coverage, or pay more than necessary.
