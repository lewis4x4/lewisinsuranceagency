# Florida No-Fault Insurance 2026: What Changes Mean for Drivers

Florida's no-fault insurance system is facing its biggest transformation in over 50 years. With pending legislation set to repeal the state's no-fault insurance law and replace it with a fault-based system effective July 1, 2026, Florida drivers need to understand what these changes mean for their coverage and costs. As your trusted insurance advisors at Lewis Insurance Agency, we're here to guide you through these historic changes affecting every driver in the Sunshine State.

## Understanding Florida's Current No-Fault System

Florida remains a no-fault state in 2025, requiring all drivers to carry Personal Injury Protection (PIP) insurance with a minimum coverage of $10,000. This system has been in place for decades, designed to provide immediate medical coverage regardless of who caused an accident.

### How PIP Currently Works

Under Florida's current no-fault system, PIP insurance provides 80% of necessary medical expenses up to your policy limit, 60% of lost wages if injuries prevent you from working, replacement services for household tasks you cannot perform, and $5,000 in death benefits. However, there's a critical deadline that many drivers don't realize: you must seek medical treatment within 14 days after the accident to qualify for any PIP benefits, and missing this window results in losing PIP benefits entirely.

An important limitation many Florida drivers discover too late is that you'll only receive the full $10,000 in PIP benefits if a healthcare provider determines you have an "emergency medical condition" from the crash, and without this medical determination, your coverage drops dramatically to just $2,500.

## The Proposed Changes: What's Coming in 2026

The Florida Legislature has been working on proposed legislation that would repeal the state's no-fault (PIP) system and increase minimum bodily injury liability coverage from the current $10,000 per person/$20,000 per incident to $25,000 per person/$50,000 per incident for bodily injury, while property damage liability remains at $10,000.

### Timeline and Implementation

The legislation provides an effective date of July 1, 2026, with insurers required to give notice by April 1, 2026, informing motor vehicle insurance policyholders that PIP is repealed and no longer required or available for purchase. This gives Florida drivers approximately six months to understand and prepare for the changes.

## Impact on Insurance Rates: The Good News

Despite concerns about premium increases, recent data shows encouraging trends. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) reports that auto insurance writers in Florida for 2025 show a -6.5% average rate change among the top insurers, reflecting improvements in the auto insurance market after recent reforms.

Governor DeSantis announced that auto insurance premiums have decreased this year, on average, by 6.5%, and Progressive Casualty Insurance Co. announced in its Third Quarter SEC filing that in early 2026 it will return $950 million in excess profits to its estimated 2.7 million policyholders in Florida.

### Rate Projections for the Transition

While no one can predict exact premium changes, a 2021 Pinnacle report estimated that premiums might increase by 13.3% (approximately $202 per vehicle annually), however, drivers rejecting medical payments coverage might see only a 1.5% increase ($23 annually). However, recent trends tell a different story with Florida's top five auto insurers indicating an average 6.5% rate decrease for 2025, and State Farm has already reduced rates by 10% while AAA has lowered premiums by 15%.

## What This Means for North Florida Drivers

For residents in our Lake City and North Florida service area, these changes will significantly impact how you're protected on the road. The removal of PIP means your own policy may no longer cover you by default, shifting more responsibility to at-fault parties.

### Key Changes for Your Coverage

1. **No More Automatic Medical Coverage**: Unlike the current system where your PIP coverage kicks in immediately, the new fault-based system means you'll need to determine who caused the accident before medical bills get paid.

2. **Higher Liability Requirements**: The new system increases minimum bodily injury liability coverage limits from $10,000 per person and $20,000 per incident to $25,000 per person and $50,000 per incident.

3. **Increased Importance of Uninsured Motorist Coverage**: With nearly one in six Florida drivers lacking adequate coverage, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage becomes more important than ever.

## Preparing for the Transition: Action Steps for Florida Drivers

### Review Your Current Policy Now

Review your current auto insurance policies now and talk to your agent about liability limits, what your current PIP covers, and how the repeal may impact you. At Lewis Insurance Agency, we're helping our clients understand their current coverage and identify potential gaps.

### Consider Higher Coverage Limits

Current minimums are modest relative to actual injury and vehicle damage costs in modern crashes, and many experts suggest higher liability limits (e.g., $100,000/$300,000) and stronger uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.

### Understand Your Health Insurance Role

Your health insurance becomes your primary protection once PIP ends, as without PIP covering your medical bills first, your health insurance takes over while fault gets determined. Review your health insurance deductibles and coverage limits to ensure adequate protection.

## Industry Opposition and Support

The proposed changes have generated significant debate. Governor Ron DeSantis and industry groups oppose the repeal, warning it could lead to increased insurance premiums, with Michael Carlson, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of Florida, stating that the shift could result in more uninsured drivers and a rise in litigation.

However, some industry experts argue that "thanks to the reforms, PIP is finally working pretty well" and that it "needs to keep shining a light on auto fraud".

## Potential Benefits of the New System

Supporters of the change point to several potential advantages:

1. **Reduced Fraud**: PIP in Florida has been plagued by fraud and questionable medical-provider billing practices, and eliminating the mandate would reduce fraudulent claims and curb certain medical-provider litigation.

2. **Better Recovery for Serious Injuries**: A fault-based system better aligns incentives and simplifies access to full recovery for seriously injured people.

3. **Expanded Damage Recovery**: The bill removes the conditional exclusion of non-economic damages for pain, suffering, mental anguish, and inconvenience and allows punitive damages awards.

## What Happens During the Transition

Insurers would rewrite policy forms, refile rates, and manage a multi-year transition, with risk selection and premium modeling changing materially. The transition period may see some temporary challenges as the industry adjusts to the new system.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my insurance premiums go up after July 2026?

Premium changes will vary by individual circumstances. While some projections suggest potential increases, recent market trends show decreasing rates, and much will depend on your driving record, coverage choices, and claims history.

### What happens if I'm in an accident after the change?

Under the new fault-based system, the at-fault driver's insurance would be responsible for covering damages. This makes having adequate liability coverage and uninsured motorist protection crucial.

### Should I increase my coverage limits now?

Yes, most experts recommend carrying higher liability limits than the minimum requirements. Consider at least $100,000/$300,000 in bodily injury coverage and adequate uninsured motorist protection.

### Will I still be able to buy medical payments coverage?

The bill leaves in place the ability of Florida drivers to purchase optional medical payments coverage, which could take the place of PIP in the event the insured is unable to recover under another driver's liability policy.

### How will this affect my current policy?

Insurers must give notice by April 1, 2026, informing policyholders that PIP is repealed, no longer required to carry PIP coverage, and PIP is no longer available for purchase.
