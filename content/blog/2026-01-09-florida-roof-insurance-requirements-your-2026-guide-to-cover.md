# Florida Roof Insurance Requirements: Your 2026 Guide to Coverage and Compliance

Florida homeowners face unique challenges when it comes to roof insurance requirements. With new legislation taking effect and insurance companies adjusting their policies, understanding these requirements is crucial for maintaining your homeowner's coverage. Recent changes to Florida's roof insurance laws have provided more protection for homeowners while establishing clearer guidelines for insurers.

## Understanding Florida's 15-Year Roof Rule

Florida's updated insurance law, Senate Bill 2-A (SB-2A), prevents insurers from dropping your policy based solely on roof age, as long as you can provide a professional inspection confirming the roof has at least 5 years of useful life remaining. This represents a significant shift from the previous approach where many insurers followed an unofficial "15-year rule."

### What This Means for Homeowners

According to Florida Statute 627.7011, insurers cannot deny or nonrenew a homeowners policy solely because the roof is less than 15 years old. For roofs that are 15 years or older, homeowners now have important rights:

- If your roof is 15 years or older, you have the right to submit a roof inspection showing at least 5 years of remaining useful life (RUL). If that report is accepted, the insurer must continue coverage
- This inspection can be conducted by an "authorized inspector," now including licensed roofing contractors under House Bill 1611, effective July 2024

## New Legislative Changes for 2026

Important changes are on the horizon for Florida homeowners. House Bill 815 (2026) will require insurers to differentiate between low-slope & steep-slope roofs in their offer for coverage under certain circumstances and allow property owners to have roof inspection performed on steep-slope roof by authorized inspector before requiring that roof be replaced. The effective date is July 1, 2026.

### Key Provisions of Upcoming Legislation

For a roof that is at least 15 years old, an insurer must differentiate between a low-slope roof with a 2-inch pitch or less and a steep-slope roof with a pitch of more than 2 inches in its offer for coverage under a policy. The roof of the residential structure performed by an authorized inspector indicates that the roof has 5 years or more of useful life remaining.

## Current Market Conditions and Statistics

The Florida insurance market is showing signs of stabilization in 2026. Homeowners are facing high premiums, with the average annual cost for $300,000 dwelling coverage reaching $5,376 statewide. However, there's encouraging news:

- Citizens, the state-backed insurer of last resort, has announced a statewide average rate reduction of 5.6% for 2025. This is welcome news for many Floridians, especially those in high-risk coastal areas
- Florida's Citizens Property Insurance Corp. will reduce rates by an average of 5.6% statewide in 2025, marking the first reduction after years of increases

### Regional Variations in North Florida

For homeowners in the Lake City and North Florida area, insurance costs tend to be more manageable than coastal regions. Average insurance premiums for homes in Florida's 67 counties ranged from $2,064 in Sumter County to $9,058 in Monroe County according to the State Office of Insurance Regulation's Jan. 1, 2025, Property Insurance Stability Report.

## Roof Inspection Requirements

When your roof reaches 15 years of age, understanding the inspection process becomes critical. For roofs at least 15 years old, Florida Statutes Chapter 627.7011 mandates that insurers must allow homeowners to retain coverage if a certified inspector verifies the roof has at least five years of useful life remaining. This "five-year certification" process typically costs $200–$400 and involves examining deck attachments, fastening methods, and overall condition.

### Who Can Perform Inspections

Authorized inspectors include a home inspector licensed under s. 468.8314; a building code inspector certified under s. 468.607; a general, building, or residential contractor licensed under s. 489.111 or a roofing contractor; a professional engineer licensed under s. 471.015; a professional architect licensed under s. 481.213.

## The 25% Replacement Rule

It's important to understand that roof insurance requirements are separate from building code requirements. When damage or planned repairs hit 25% of any roof section, the Florida building code roof rules require you to replace that entire section and bring it up to current code. A section is defined by valleys, hips, ridges, or major slope changes.

Insurance adjusters know this rule. They're limiting payouts to actual damage instead of approving full replacements like before.

## Wind Mitigation and Premium Discounts

Florida law requires insurers to provide discounts for homes with wind mitigation features. Florida roof insurance requirements now mandate that insurers offer premium credits for homes meeting windstorm mitigation standards, but you need a certified inspection. The inspector checks roof-to-wall connections, deck attachment, roof covering, geometry, and opening protection.

### Potential Savings

Homes with hurricane straps, sealed decks, and impact-resistant materials can save 10% to 45% on premiums. That's $300 to $1,350 yearly on a $3,000 policy. Over 25 years, you're looking at $30,000 in savings.

The key benefits of wind mitigation include:
- Hurricane straps and reinforced connections
- Impact-resistant roofing materials
- Proper deck attachment methods
- Secondary water barriers

## Roof Types and Insurance Considerations

Different roof types receive varying treatment from insurance companies:

### Asphalt Shingle Roofs
This is the material most tied to SB-2A. During a roof inspection, professionals evaluate granule loss, flexibility and brittleness, curling edges, cracked shingles, soft decking, and failing seals and adhesives. These factors determine whether the roof meets the 5-year remaining life requirement.

### Tile and Metal Roofs
Tile roofs typically last 30–50+ years, but insurers still expect proof of condition. Metal roofs often receive favorable treatment due to their durability and wind resistance.

## What to Do If You Receive a Non-Renewal Notice

If you receive a non-renewal notice citing roof age, don't panic. Here's what you should know:

- Under current law, your insurer must provide a reason for any nonrenewal. If your roof is under 15 years old, and you receive a nonrenewal notice citing roof age, you may have legal grounds to challenge it
- Don't wait for a nonrenewal letter. Talk to your insurance agent, check your roof's age, and get ahead of any inspection needs. For help understanding your policy or setting up a roof inspection, contact your local insurance agent

## Planning for the Future

If your roof is approaching 15 years old, start planning now. Consider these proactive steps:

1. **Document your roof's age** and keep records of any repairs or improvements
2. **Schedule regular maintenance** to extend your roof's useful life
3. **Consider upgrading** to more durable materials during replacement
4. **Obtain wind mitigation inspections** to maximize discounts

## Recent Reform Benefits

The insurance market is stabilizing thanks to legislative reforms. Insurers have to disclose roof deductibles and can no longer deny entire roof claims based on age alone if a storm causes damage. Consumer organizations have advocated for such reforms to safeguard consumer rights and prevent discrimination against policyholders in the claims process.
