# Florida PIP Coverage Explained: Your Complete Guide for 2026

If you're a Florida driver, understanding Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage is crucial for your financial security. Florida's Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law requires all owners or registrants of motor vehicles with four or more wheels to carry PIP insurance, which covers up to $10,000 in emergency medical and disability benefits. However, major changes are coming in 2026 that every North Florida driver needs to know about.

At Lewis Insurance Agency, we've been helping Lake City residents navigate Florida's insurance requirements since 1981. This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about PIP coverage, including the upcoming legislative changes that could dramatically impact your auto insurance.

## What is Florida PIP Coverage?

PIP stands for Personal Injury Protection. In essence, it's insurance coverage designed to cover your medical expenses, lost wages, and other related costs if you're injured in an accident—no matter who was at fault. This "no-fault" element means that, regardless of who caused the accident, you can rely on your PIP benefits to help with immediate expenses.

Any vehicle with a current Florida registration must be insured with PIP and PDL insurance at the time of vehicle registration, with a minimum of $10,000 in PIP AND a minimum of $10,000 in PDL.

### Current PIP Coverage Benefits

Florida's PIP coverage is designed to be comprehensive in addressing the immediate impacts of an accident. Here's what it generally includes: Medical Expenses covering up to 80% of reasonable medical costs, such as doctor visits, hospital bills, surgery, and rehabilitation. Lost Wages compensating for up to 60% of lost income if injuries prevent you from working. Death Benefits providing a benefit to your beneficiaries if the accident results in a fatality. Other Expenses may cover additional necessary services, such as household help if your injuries limit your ability to perform daily tasks.

The specific breakdown includes:
- PIP coverage pays 80 percent of medical bills incurred because of the crash up to the policy limit
- It pays 60 percent of lost wages if the injured individual cannot work
- If a person needs replacement services, PIP coverage pays 100 percent for these losses
- In the tragic event of a fatality, Florida PIP can cover up to $5,000 for funeral and burial expenses

## Critical PIP Rules Every Florida Driver Must Know

### The 14-Day Rule

One of the most important aspects of Florida PIP coverage is the strict timing requirement. To ensure you are eligible for any PIP benefits, you must seek initial medical services and care within 14 days after the motor vehicle accident. Of course, the primary reason to seek care is your health, but immediate medical attention is also required to secure your PIP benefits. Failure to seek treatment within this window can often result in the forfeiture or denial of your PIP benefits.

### Coverage Limitations

The $10,000 minimum PIP coverage applies only to injuries classified as an emergency medical condition (EMC). If your injury doesn't meet this classification, your PIP benefits may cap at $2,500. This significant difference makes understanding the classification of your injuries crucial for maximizing your benefits.

While PIP provides extensive coverage, it is crucial to understand its limitations. The standard coverage limit in Florida is $10,000, which may not fully cover all expenses in severe cases. Additionally, PIP covers only 80% of medical expenses and 60% of lost wages. These coverage gaps highlight the importance of considering additional coverage options to ensure comprehensive protection in the event of major accidents.

## Major Changes Coming in 2026: PIP Repeal

The biggest news for Florida drivers is the potential elimination of mandatory PIP coverage. Florida's move away from mandatory PIP coverage represents the biggest change to auto insurance in over 50 years.

### What's Changing

Starting July 1, 2026, Florida drivers will be required to carry bodily injury liability coverage of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident, along with $5,000 in medical payment (MedPay) coverage. This replaces the current PIP requirement.

The bill increases the minimum BI liability coverage limits from $10,000 per person and $20,000 per incident to $25,000 per person and $50,000 per incident, but the minimum property damage ("PD") liability coverage limit remains unchanged at $10,000. This results in required 25/50/10 coverage in most instances.

### Impact on Your Coverage

Once PIP disappears, your personal health insurance will need to cover your medical bills while fault gets sorted out. Right now, PIP serves as primary coverage up to $10,000 with health insurance as secondary. That safety net disappears in 2026.

Under the new system, you become personally responsible for paying other people's medical bills and damages. Your bodily injury coverage becomes the primary payment source for these costs. This represents a complete flip from today's system where your own insurance covers your injuries first.

## Financial Impact of the Changes

### Potential Savings

Most Florida drivers stand to benefit from potential annual savings of $349 according to recent analyses. State Farm has already reduced rates by 10% (their third reduction since 2024), whereas AAA has lowered premiums by 15% through three separate decreases.

However, the impact varies significantly by individual circumstances. Some industry experts warn of possible premium increases between 48% to 77% for certain motorists.

### What This Means for North Florida Drivers

For Lake City and surrounding North Florida communities, these changes require careful consideration. Rural areas often have longer emergency response times, making the immediate coverage provided by PIP particularly valuable. The transition to a fault-based system could mean longer delays in receiving compensation while fault is determined.

## Who Needs PIP Coverage Right Now?

Currently, PIP coverage is mandatory for most Florida drivers, but there are specific requirements and exceptions:

### Required Coverage
- Under Florida law, all vehicle owners are required to secure a minimum of $10,000 in PIP insurance. It's important to note that this coverage must be maintained continuously throughout the vehicle's registration period
- Non-Florida residents who operate their vehicle in the state for more than 90 days within a 365-day period are required to purchase PIP insurance. The 90 days do not need to be consecutive. Nonresident drivers must also ensure their vehicle is registered in Florida if they meet the above usage criteria

### Exemptions
- If you are a snowbird, and your vehicle is registered and plated in another state, where your other residence is located, then you are not required to have PIP coverage in Florida. You are, however, required to have at least the minimum coverage required by your state to operate a motor vehicle legally in Florida. Otherwise, if your car is registered and plated in Florida, you must have PIP coverage, even when you are at your other home outside of Florida

## How PIP Interacts with Health Insurance

One common question Florida drivers have is how PIP coverage interacts with their health insurance. Typically, PIP is the primary coverage that kicks in after an accident, even if you have health insurance. Once your PIP benefits are exhausted, your health insurance may step in to cover additional costs, depending on your policy.

This coordination becomes especially important given recent health insurance trends. Health insurance rates will increase sharply for the 4 million-plus Floridians who rely on so-called Obamacare plans or small employer health insurance coverage, with Florida health plans approved for double-digit increases in monthly premiums.

## Preparing for the 2026 Transition

With the potential elimination of PIP coverage looming, Florida drivers need to start preparing now:

### Review Your Current Coverage

Deciding whether Florida's minimum coverages are enough is a personal decision. However, the required minimum amounts could be considered relatively low. In the event you are in a car accident and sustain injuries or cause injuries to others, with only the minimum coverage, your insurance will only pay up to $10,000. Unfortunately, this could leave you paying for any additional amounts above the $10,000 coverage out of your own pocket.

### Consider Additional Protection

Adding uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage becomes even more important given how many drivers maintain inadequate insurance. This makes uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage more important than ever, especially with nearly one in six Florida drivers lacking adequate coverage.

The [Florida Office of Insurance Regulation](https://www.floir.com/) provides official updates on insurance requirements and regulations.

### Shop Around for Coverage

Auto insurance shopping jumped 16% year-over-year in Q1 of 2025, creating more competition and better rates for smart shoppers. Rates vary significantly between companies, so getting quotes from multiple carriers makes sense. Timing matters too—if your current carrier plans a 2026 rebate based on 2025 policy activity, staying with them through that period might benefit your wallet.

## Common PIP Claims Process

Understanding how to file a PIP claim is essential for maximizing your benefits:

### Steps to File a Claim
Filing a Personal Injury Protection (PIP) insurance claim in Florida is straightforward, reflecting the no-fault system designed to facilitate quick access to medical treatment and compensation. As soon as you can after an accident, call your insurance company. Confirm that your policy includes PIP coverage and note down your coverage limits. During your initial call, make sure to get a claim number and the contact details for the claims department. This will be crucial for all your subsequent communications.

### Payment Timeline
The process of receiving benefits from PIP insurance in Florida is strictly governed by state law. Generally, once the insurance company receives reasonable proof of your injuries, they are required to pay your claim within 30 days.

## FAQ Section

### What happens if I don't have PIP coverage in Florida?
Failure to maintain required insurance coverage in Florida may result in the suspension of your driver license/registration and a requirement to pay a reinstatement fee of up to $500. Currently, PIP coverage is mandatory for all registered vehicles in Florida.

### Will PIP coverage definitely be eliminated in 2026?
The measures have failed to pass in previous sessions, and the fate of a similar bill in the upcoming 2026 Legislature is uncertain. While legislation has been introduced, final passage is not guaranteed.

### How will the 2026 changes affect my premiums?
The impact on premiums is not entirely clear. While some projections suggest potential increases, recent trends show major insurers reducing rates. The actual effect may vary based on individual circumstances and coverage choices.

### Can I increase my PIP coverage above the minimum?
Some insurance companies in Florida allow you to adjust your PIP coverage. For example, you may be able to pay for "extended PIP coverage," where 100% of medical expenses and 80% of lost wages and services are paid for.

### What should I do to prepare for potential changes?
Don't wait until 2026 to start planning. Early preparation helps you avoid coverage gaps and gives you time to find the best rates for your situation. Consider reviewing your current coverage, exploring additional protection options, and consulting with an experienced insurance agent.

## Conclusion: Navigate Florida's Insurance Changes with Confidence
