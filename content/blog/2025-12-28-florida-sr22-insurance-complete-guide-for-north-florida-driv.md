# Florida SR-22 Insurance: Complete Guide for North Florida Drivers

If you've been notified that you need SR-22 insurance in Florida, you're likely dealing with one of the most challenging aspects of auto insurance. Don't worry – you're not alone, and there are affordable solutions available right here in North Florida. Understanding your options can help you get back on the road quickly while meeting all state requirements.

## What Is SR-22 Insurance in Florida?

SR-22 isn't a special insurance policy at all—it's a certificate your insurer files with the state to prove you carry the required liability coverage. It is a Certificate of Financial Responsibility filed by your insurer with the Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) to verify you carry state-mandated liability coverage.

You can't purchase a standalone "SR-22 policy." Instead, the SR-22 filing is added to a compliant auto policy, and your insurer submits it electronically. The SR-22 is an electronic filing added to a standard auto insurance policy that meets the mandated limits.

The key thing to remember is that the certificate is not what raises your premium. Your rate increases primarily stem from the violation(s) that triggered the requirement.

## When Do You Need SR-22 Insurance in Florida?

Drivers designated as high risk due to violations such as DUI, driving without insurance, at-fault crashes without insurance, reckless driving, or excessive points leading to suspension typically need SR-22 filing. However, it's important to note that Florida requires an FR-44 for DUI convictions. Unlike most states, Florida requires an FR-44 for DUI convictions.

Common situations requiring SR-22 in Florida include:

- Your license has been revoked or suspended and you need to reinstate it
- At-fault accidents to prove financial responsibility. Without bodily injury coverage, the state mandates SR22 filing with your insurer.
- Involvement in a car accident without valid insurance. A series of traffic violations within a short period. Driving without a valid license or proof of insurance.
- Accumulating too many points on your license

## SR-22 vs FR-44: Understanding Florida's Requirements

Florida and Virginia, however, implemented the FR-44 for certain severe violations, primarily those involving alcohol or drugs. The rationale behind this stricter requirement is to ensure that drivers who have committed high-risk offenses carry insurance limits substantial enough to cover the potentially catastrophic damages from a serious accident.

### SR-22 Requirements:
- $10,000 property damage liability per crash, and $10,000 PIP per person per crash
- Bodily Injury Liability Insurance: Minimum of $10,000 per person and $20,000 per accident. Property Damage Liability Insurance: Minimum of $10,000. Personal Injury Protection (PIP): At least $10,000.

### FR-44 Requirements (for DUI):
- FR-44 form certifies you hold bodily injury liability coverage of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident and property damage liability of $50,000

## How Much Does SR-22 Insurance Cost in Florida?

The cost varies significantly based on your specific situation. Recent data shows:

- State Farm offers the cheapest Florida SR-22 insurance, with average monthly rates of $156 and an annual premium of $1,866
- Quotes start at $114 per month
- These rates average $808 a year for minimum-liability SR-22 insurance, or $67 a month. Geico's rates average $67 a month for minimum-liability SR-22 insurance after a minor offense

### Filing Fees:
Filing for an SR-22 requires a nominal fee of $15 to $25, while anticipate a cost ranging between $15 and $35 for obtaining your Florida non-owner SR 22 filing.

### Rate Increases:
If you held a regular car insurance policy in the past and your driving record has encountered issues, it's probable that you will face a substantial rise in your insurance rates. Your premium might increase by as much as 40% to 70%.

For North Florida residents around Lake City, rural locations may have different pricing than urban areas. Larger cities will higher amounts of accidents/claims may cost more for insurance than smaller cities.

## Types of SR-22 Coverage Available

There are three different types of SR-22 forms: Owner: Covers you only when driving a car you own. Owner-Operator: Covers you when driving your car and cars owned by others. Non-owner: Covers you if you don't own a car but drive cars owned by others.

### Non-Owner SR-22 Insurance

If you don't own a vehicle, a driver who does not have a vehicle registered in their name may purchase a Non-owner policy. Non-owner policies cost far less and carry significantly lower premiums, while still meeting compliance for all SR-22 and FR44 requirements.

This is particularly useful for Lake City residents who may rely on family vehicles or public transportation but still need to maintain their driving privileges.
