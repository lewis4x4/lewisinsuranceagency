Picture this: Your Fort Lauderdale condo's HOA fees just jumped from $800 to $1,200 per month, your Citizens policy is being transferred to a company you've never heard of, and you're trying to figure out why your HO-6 policy won't cover the water damage from your neighbor's unit above. The proportion of a condo unit's monthly fees going toward insurance rose 25% to $377 a month, with the average high-rise condo owner in Fort Lauderdale/Palm Beach paying $438 a month for its association's insurance this year. Welcome to Florida's condo insurance landscape in 2025 – where a local agent's expertise isn't just helpful, it's essential.

Florida condo owners face unique challenges that generic online platforms simply can't navigate. In a Florida condo, owners must carry their own insurance on top of the HOA's master policy, with the median sale price for a Florida condo dropping to $285,000, down 8.1% from a year earlier. The complexity goes beyond just dual coverage requirements. More than 648,000 Citizens policies are slated for transfer to private insurers, a move authorized by Florida lawmakers in December 2022 during a special legislative session. Each transfer brings different coverage terms, premium changes, and potential gaps that require careful review.

When you call a 1-800 number or buy direct online, you're dealing with representatives who may never have heard of Florida's Milestone Inspection requirements or understood why your Surfside-era building needs special consideration. Post-Surfside, Florida passed Milestone Inspection and Structural Integrity Reserve Studies (SIRS) requirements, with condos now required to conduct building inspections by licensed engineers and fully fund reserves for structural repairs. These representatives can't explain why your policy might conflict with your HOA's master coverage, or why Fannie Mae maintains a blacklist of condo properties it will not back, forcing buyers to find alternative financing.

At Lewis Insurance Agency, our 44 years of experience in North Florida means we understand the intricate dance between your HO-6 policy and your association's master coverage. We work with multiple carriers to find coverage that complements – not duplicates – your HOA's insurance. When condo insurance costs increased from an average of about $405 to $500 annually to about $900 to just over $1,000 a year in some sectors, with South Florida seeing upwards of $5,000 to $10,000 a year, we help you understand exactly what's driving those increases and find ways to manage costs without leaving dangerous gaps in coverage.

Don't navigate Florida's complex condo insurance market alone. Whether you're dealing with a Citizens takeout, facing skyrocketing HOA fees, or trying to understand coverage gaps between your personal policy and your association's master coverage, Lewis Insurance Agency provides the local expertise you need.
