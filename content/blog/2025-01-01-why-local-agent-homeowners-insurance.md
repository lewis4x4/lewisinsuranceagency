Owning a home in Florida means dealing with risks that homeowners in Ohio or Michigan never think about. Hurricanes, tropical storms, water damage from afternoon thunderstorms, and even sinkholes in certain parts of the state. A standard homeowners policy written for somewhere else doesn't account for any of that.

Here's what catches most Florida homeowners off guard: your basic policy probably doesn't cover flood damage. It might exclude wind damage above a certain threshold. And if your roof is older than 15 years, many carriers won't write you a policy at all—or they'll exclude the roof from coverage entirely.

Lewis Insurance Agency has been helping Florida homeowners sort through these details since 1981. We know which carriers are still actively writing policies in high-risk coastal areas. We understand the difference between replacement cost and actual cash value, and we'll explain why that matters when you're filing a claim after a storm. We can walk you through what a 4-point inspection covers, whether you need a wind mitigation report, and how those documents can actually lower your premium.

Florida homeownership comes with unique challenges. Your insurance should come from someone who understands them—not a 1-800 number that treats your home like every other home in America.
