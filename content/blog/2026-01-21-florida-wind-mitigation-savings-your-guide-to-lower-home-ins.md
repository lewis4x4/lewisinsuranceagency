# Florida Wind Mitigation Savings: Your Guide to Lower Home Insurance

Living in North Florida means dealing with hurricane season every year, but it also means you have unique opportunities to save substantially on your homeowners insurance through **Florida wind mitigation savings**. With recent changes to the insurance landscape and new funding for home hardening programs, there's never been a better time to explore these money-saving options.

## Understanding Wind Mitigation Discounts in 2026

Wind mitigation credits are discounts on your homeowner's insurance premium given for features that make your home more resistant to wind damage. In states like Florida (where hurricanes are a fact of life), insurers are generally required under Florida law to file and make available actuarially supported wind-mitigation discounts to homeowners who harden their homes against windstorms.

The concept is straightforward: a home that can withstand high winds is less likely to suffer major damage during a hurricane, which means fewer costly claims for the insurer. It's a win-win: your home is safer, and you pay less for insurance.

### Current Insurance Market Conditions

Florida's insurance market has shown encouraging signs of stabilization in recent months. As of late November 2025, Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation had received 73 filings for rate decreases and 94 filings for 0% rate increases. The average annual homeowner's insurance premium in Florida, including wind coverage, is now $3,815. While that figure is up about 6% from a year ago, it represents a significant slowdown from the double-digit annual increases seen in prior years.

Statewide, Citizens' rates will go down by 8.7% on average, and more than 150,000 Citizens policyholders will receive a reduction of 10% or more beginning in spring 2026.

## The My Safe Florida Home Program Returns with $280 Million

One of the most exciting developments for Florida homeowners is the return of the My Safe Florida Home program. The new budget includes $94 million for My Safe Florida Home mitigation grants, $1.5 million for inspections, $4.7 million for administrative costs, and a nonrecurring sum of $180 million for the program moving forward for fiscal year 2025-2026.

### How the Program Works

The My Safe Florida Home Program provides eligible Florida homeowners with free home inspections for hurricane readiness and offers recommendations for wind mitigation features such as roofing materials, better exterior and garage doors, storm shutters, attachments for walls and roofs like hurricane clips and more.

The program offers significant financial benefits:

- Homeowners who receive the inspection may also apply for matching grant funds to help pay for any recommended improvements, with the state matching $2 for every dollar the homeowners spend, up to a cap of $10,000
- Just getting the inspection can help homeowners save money on their insurance premiums if they have existing wind mitigation features
- Last year, on average, thousands of Florida homeowners saved $932

### Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the program, your home must meet specific criteria:

- The building permit of the home must have been issued before Jan. 1, 2008
- Single-family, detached residential property or townhouse
- Must be your primary residence
- To qualify for a free inspection, you'd need to have a single-family, site-built home that is your primary residence with less than $500,000 of dwelling coverage. You'd also need to have a homestead exemption

Priority is given to homeowners who are 60 or older and those who qualify as low- or moderate-income residents.

## Key Wind Mitigation Features That Save Money

Wind mitigation inspections examine several critical aspects of your home's construction. Understanding these features can help you identify potential savings opportunities:

### Roof Features

**Roof Shape**: Hip roofs generally qualify for better discounts than gable roofs because they're more aerodynamic and resist wind uplift better.

**Roof Covering**: The most common in Florida are Asphalt Shingle (architectural or 3-tab) and Concrete or Clay Tile applications. However, Metal, Built-up, Membrane and Other are identified on the Wind Mitigation form that qualify for a policy discount.

**Roof Deck Attachment**: A roof deck is generally made up of steel, concrete, or wood. Steel and concrete are generally considered superior materials, but a wood deck is the most common for single family homes. The roof deck attachment connects the roof deck to the trusses or rafters by various types of plywood and nails.

### Opening Protection

This refers to hurricane shutters, impact-resistant windows, or impact doors that protect your home's openings from wind-borne debris.

### Secondary Water Resistance

This feature prevents water intrusion if the primary roof covering is damaged during a storm.

## Potential Savings for North Florida Homeowners

The savings from wind mitigation can be substantial. Many homeowners may see enough discounts to cover the inspection cost within the first year (results vary by carrier, rating factors, and credits).

For homes in the North Florida region, including Lake City, insurance premiums are typically lower than coastal areas. Premiums closer to statewide averages can be found in the central region of the state, including the Tampa and Orlando areas, while homes in northern inland counties can typically be insured for below-average prices.

### Progressive's Wind Mitigation Credits

Homeowners and dwelling policyholders that have Windstorm or Hail as a defined covered loss on their policy, a policy credit (up to a maximum of 90% inclusive of any Building Code Effectiveness Grading discount) may be available to you. Premium credits are applied from the date of the wind mitigation inspection or to the start of your Progressive Home policy, whichever occurs later.

### Homes Built After 2002

Good news for newer construction: If your home was built after 2002—good news! You automatically receive default credits on your Progressive homeowners policy. But more discounts may be available to you.

## The Wind Mitigation Inspection Process

### Who Can Perform Inspections

A qualified and/or licensed inspector is defined by: Home inspector licensed under Section 468.8314, Florida Statutes who has completed the statutory number of hours of hurricane mitigation training approved by the Construction Industry Licensing Board and completion of a proficiency exam. Building code inspector certified under Section 468.607, Florida Statues. General, building, or residential contractor licensed under Section 489.111, Florida Statues. Professional engineer licensed under Section 471.015, Florida Statues. Professional architect licensed under Section 481.213, Florida Statues.

### Inspection Validity

The Uniform Mitigation Verification Inspection Form (OIR-B1-1802) is valid for up to five (5) years provided no material changes are made to the structure or inaccuracies are found on the form.

### Cost Considerations

While some homeowners qualify for free inspections through the My Safe Florida Home program, others may need to pay for the service. However, Homeowners who don't qualify for a free wind mitigation inspection can pay to have one done. The cost is usually worth the insurance discount.

## Specific Steps to Maximize Your Savings

### 1. Get Your Wind Mitigation Inspection

Start by determining if you qualify for a free inspection through the My Safe Florida Home program. If not, hire a qualified inspector to complete the OIR-B1-1802 form.

### 2. Consider Upgrades for Older Homes

If your home was built prior to 2002, you're not out of luck. You may still qualify for discounts if you have since installed mitigation features or construction techniques.

### 3. Document Everything

Wind mitigation inspections stay valid for 5 years per FS 627.711, so keep your documentation safe and organized.

### 4. Work with Your Insurance Agent

Contact your insurance agent to ensure you're receiving all available discounts. [INTERNAL_LINK:florida-homeowners-insurance-discounts] can significantly reduce your premiums when properly applied.

## Regional Considerations for North Florida

Living in North Florida offers some advantages when it comes to insurance costs. The Lake City area and surrounding counties typically see lower premiums than coastal regions due to reduced hurricane risk. However, wind mitigation features are still valuable because:

- They provide additional protection during severe weather events
- Insurance companies recognize and reward these features regardless of location
- The savings can be substantial even on lower base premiums

## Legislative Updates and Market Changes

Florida's recent legislative reforms have created a more stable insurance environment. Section 627.0629, Florida Statutes, requires all residential property insurers, effective October 1, 2023, to provide information on the insurer's website describing the hurricane mitigation discounts available to policyholders.

These reforms are producing tangible results: Since the enactment of these reforms, 17 new insurance companies have entered Florida, increasing competition. Dozens of homeowners and auto insurers have filed for rate decreases.
