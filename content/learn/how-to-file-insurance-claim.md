## The Simple Answer

Document everything first, then call your insurance company (or us) to report the damage. Take photos and videos before making temporary repairs. Don't throw anything away until the adjuster sees it. The faster you file, the faster you get paid.

## Features & Benefits

| Step | What To Do | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1. Stay Safe | Don't enter damaged areas until it's safe | Your safety comes first |
| 2. Document | Photo and video all damage before touching anything | This is your proof |
| 3. Prevent Further Damage | Make temporary repairs (tarp roof, board windows) | Required by your policy—save receipts |
| 4. Report the Claim | Call your agent or insurer's claims line | Starts the clock on your claim |
| 5. Meet the Adjuster | Be present, point out all damage | They may miss hidden damage |
| 6. Get Estimates | Obtain contractor bids for repairs | Helps negotiate fair settlement |
| 7. Review Settlement | Don't sign until you understand what's covered | You can dispute if it's too low |

**Important Deadlines:**
- Report property damage claims promptly (most policies require "immediate" notice)
- Florida law gives you 2 years to file a hurricane claim (but don't wait)
- Keep all receipts for temporary repairs and living expenses
