## The Simple Answer

Florida insurance rates are rising for everyone—and it's not because of anything you did. Increased hurricane activity, rising construction costs, lawsuit abuse, and insurers leaving the state have created a crisis. But there are still ways to reduce your premium without reducing your protection.

## Features & Benefits

| Reason Rates Increase | What's Happening |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Hurricane Losses | Insurers paid billions in storm claims over the past decade |
| Reinsurance Costs | The insurance companies' insurance got more expensive |
| Construction Costs | Materials and labor cost 30%+ more than five years ago |
| Litigation Abuse | Florida accounts for 79% of U.S. homeowner insurance lawsuits |
| Carriers Leaving | Fewer companies = less competition = higher prices |
| Inflation | Replacement costs for your home have increased |

**Ways to Lower Your Premium:**
- Increase your deductible (especially hurricane deductible)
- Bundle home and auto with the same carrier
- Get a wind mitigation inspection for discounts
- Install impact windows or hurricane shutters
- Improve your credit score
- Ask about loyalty discounts
- Shop your policy every 2–3 years

> — **Cheryl M., Gainesville**

> "Lewis has been reviewing my policy every year since 2012. When rates spiked, they moved me to a new carrier that saved me money. That's why I stay with an independent agent."
