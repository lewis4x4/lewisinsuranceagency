## The Simple Answer

Yes. Your landlord's insurance covers the building—not your stuff. If there's a fire, theft, or water damage, your furniture, electronics, clothes, and everything else you own isn't covered unless you have renters insurance. It's cheap protection for everything you'd have to replace.

> — **Marcus T., Lake City**
