## The Simple Answer

Liability insurance protects your business when someone claims you caused them harm—whether it's a customer who slips on your floor, a client who says your work damaged their property, or a lawsuit over something you said. It pays for legal defense and settlements so one accident doesn't bankrupt your company.
