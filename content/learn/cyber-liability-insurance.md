## The Simple Answer

## What Our Clients Say

> "Someone hacked our email and sent fake invoices to our clients. We lost $12,000 before we caught it. Cyber insurance covered the loss and paid for a security audit. Could have been much worse."
> — **Steven M., Lake City (Accounting Firm)**

> "Ransomware locked all our files and demanded $25,000. The cyber policy Lewis recommended covered the ransom, the IT recovery, and the business income we lost during the three days we were down."
> — **Laura K., Gainesville (Medical Practice)**

> "I thought cyber insurance was only for big companies. Lewis showed me a policy for $400 a year that covers $100,000 in cyber losses. That's cheap peace of mind."
