## The Simple Answer

A captive agent works for one insurance company and can only sell that company's products. An independent agent represents multiple carriers and shops the market to find you the best coverage at the best price. When your rates go up with a captive agent, your only option is to pay more or leave. With an independent agent, we find you alternatives.

## Features & Benefits

| | Independent Agent | Captive Agent |
|---|-------------------|---------------|
| Number of Carriers | Multiple (often 10–20+) | One company only |
| Who They Work For | You, the customer | The insurance company |
| Shopping Ability | Compares options across carriers | Limited to one company's products |
| When Rates Increase | Finds competitive alternatives | Can only offer what they have |
| Claims Advocacy | Advocates for you with the carrier | May have conflict of interest |
| Policy Flexibility | Mixes carriers for best coverage | Must bundle with same company |
| Local Knowledge | Knows regional carriers and risks | Corporate guidelines may not fit local needs |

**Why Independent Matters in Florida:**
- Florida's market changes constantly—carriers enter and leave
- Rate increases vary wildly by company
- Some carriers specialize in coastal, others in inland properties
- You need someone who can pivot when the market shifts

## What Our Clients Say

> "My old agent worked for one company. When they raised my rate 40%, he said there was nothing he could do. Lewis found me the same coverage for $1,100 less with a different carrier."
> — **Dorothy A., Lake City**

> "I like having one agent who handles my home, auto, flood, and umbrella—even though they're with three different companies. Lewis puts together the best combination for me."
> — **Richard and Ellen T., Gainesville**

> "When my insurance company left Florida, my captive agent couldn't help me. Lewis got me covered with a new carrier in two days. That's why independent agents matter."
