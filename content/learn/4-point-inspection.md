## The Simple Answer

A 4-point inspection examines the four major systems in your home: roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC. Most Florida insurance companies require this inspection for homes over 20–30 years old before they'll issue or renew a policy. It typically costs $75–$150 and helps insurers assess the risk of insuring an older home.
