## Short Answer

Florida homeowners insurance typically has two separate deductibles. Your hurricane deductible is a percentage of your dwelling coverage (often 2-5%) and applies to hurricane or named storm damage. Your all-other-perils (AOP) deductible is a flat dollar amount (like $1,000 or $2,500) and applies to everything else—fire, theft, water damage, etc.

## Why It Matters in Florida

Understanding your deductibles is crucial because they directly affect what you'll pay out of pocket when you file a claim.

**Hurricane Deductible Example:**
- Your home is insured for $300,000
- You have a 2% hurricane deductible
- Your out-of-pocket for hurricane damage: $6,000

- Same home with a 5% hurricane deductible
- Your out-of-pocket: $15,000

**AOP Deductible Example:**
- You have a $2,500 AOP deductible
- A pipe bursts causing $8,000 in damage
- Your out-of-pocket: $2,500 (insurance pays $5,500)

Many homeowners don't realize their hurricane deductible is a percentage until a storm hits. The difference between a 2% and 5% deductible can mean thousands of dollars in your pocket—or the insurance company's.

## How to Decide

When choosing your deductibles, consider:

- **Your emergency fund:** Can you afford a 5% hurricane deductible if a storm hits? If your home is insured for $400,000, that's $20,000 out of pocket.
- **Premium impact:** Higher deductibles lower your premium. You might save hundreds per year with a 5% hurricane deductible vs. 2%—but you're taking on more risk.
- **Your risk tolerance:** Some homeowners prefer lower deductibles for peace of mind, even at a higher premium.
