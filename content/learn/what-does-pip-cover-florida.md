## Short Answer

PIP (Personal Injury Protection) is Florida's required no-fault auto insurance coverage. It pays for your medical expenses after a car accident regardless of who caused it, up to your policy limit—typically $10,000. PIP also covers a portion of lost wages and, in fatal accidents, death benefits.

## Why It Matters in Florida

Florida is one of a handful of no-fault states, which means your own insurance pays for your injuries first—regardless of who caused the accident. This is designed to get you medical treatment quickly without waiting to determine fault.

PIP covers:

- **Medical expenses:** Doctor visits, hospital stays, surgery, physical therapy, and other medical care related to the accident
- **Lost wages:** Up to 60% of your lost income if you can't work due to injuries
- **Death benefits:** $5,000 for funeral and related expenses

The standard limit is $10,000, which can be used up quickly with serious injuries. That's why many Florida drivers add Medical Payments (MedPay) coverage or higher liability limits for additional protection.

## How to Decide

When reviewing your PIP options, consider:

- **Deductible choices:** You can choose deductibles from $0 to $1,000 or more. A higher deductible lowers your premium but means more out-of-pocket when you file a claim.
- **Coordination with health insurance:** You may be able to elect to have health insurance pay first through a PIP deductible election, potentially lowering your auto premium.
- **Additional coverage:** MedPay can supplement PIP to cover medical expenses beyond the $10,000 limit.
