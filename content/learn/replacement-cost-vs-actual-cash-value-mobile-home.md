## Short Answer

Replacement cost coverage pays to repair or replace your manufactured home with a new one of similar quality—without deducting for depreciation. Actual cash value (ACV) pays what your home is worth today, considering its age and wear. For a 20-year-old mobile home, the difference at claim time can be substantial.

## Why It Matters in Florida

Mobile homes depreciate over time, just like vehicles. A manufactured home that cost $80,000 new might have an actual cash value of only $25,000 or $30,000 after 15-20 years. If your home is destroyed and you only have ACV coverage, you'd receive the depreciated amount—likely not enough to buy a comparable new home.

**Example comparison:**
- Your manufactured home is 15 years old
- It would cost $90,000 to replace with a similar new home
- Its actual cash value (depreciated) might be $35,000

With replacement cost coverage, you'd receive up to $90,000 to replace your home. With ACV coverage, you'd receive around $35,000—leaving a significant gap.

Replacement cost coverage costs more, but it provides much better protection if the worst happens. In hurricane-prone Florida, that protection can be especially valuable.

## How to Decide

When choosing between replacement cost and ACV:

- **Your home's age:** The older your home, the bigger the gap between replacement cost and ACV—and the more valuable replacement cost coverage becomes.
- **Your financial situation:** Could you afford to make up the difference if you received only the ACV payout? If not, replacement cost is worth the higher premium.
- **Your long-term plans:** If you plan to stay in your manufactured home for years, replacement cost protection is more valuable than if you plan to move soon.

Most financial experts recommend replacement cost coverage for your dwelling. The premium difference is often reasonable compared to the protection it provides.
