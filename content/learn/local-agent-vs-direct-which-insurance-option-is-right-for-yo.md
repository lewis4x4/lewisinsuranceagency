## The Simple Answer

Local agents provide personalized service, help with complex needs, and offer multiple carrier options, while direct insurers can be cheaper by eliminating agent commissions but offer limited guidance. In Florida's improving insurance market, 78% of homeowners report satisfaction with carrier communication, making either option viable depending on your specific needs.
