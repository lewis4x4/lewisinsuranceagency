## The Simple Answer

Your homeowners insurance covers wind, fire, theft, and liability. Flood insurance covers rising water. In Florida, you need both—they're two separate policies that work together to fully protect your home.

> — **Maria T., Lake City**

> "I didn't think I needed flood insurance because I'm not near the water. Lewis showed me my flood zone rating and explained my risk. Six months later, my street flooded from a summer storm. Best decision I ever made."
> — **James R., Gainesville**

> "Lewis Insurance has handled my homeowners and flood policies since 2005. When I had roof damage from wind AND water damage in my garage from the same storm, they knew exactly which claim went where. Made a nightmare situation manageable."
