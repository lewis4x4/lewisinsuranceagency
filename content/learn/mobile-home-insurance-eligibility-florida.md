## Short Answer

Several factors affect whether you can get mobile home insurance in Florida and how much you'll pay: your home's year of manufacture, roof type and condition, tie-down/anchoring system, and overall condition. Older manufactured homes (pre-1980 or pre-1990 in some cases) may have limited carrier options but can often still find coverage.

## Why It Matters in Florida

Florida's hurricane risk makes mobile home insurance more challenging than in other states. Insurers evaluate manufactured homes carefully because older homes, improperly anchored homes, or homes with aged roofs present higher risk during storms.

**Key factors insurers look at:**

- **Year built:** Homes built after 1994 generally have better options because they were built to HUD standards that include improved wind resistance. Homes from the 1970s or earlier may have fewer carriers willing to provide coverage.

- **Tie-downs/anchoring:** Florida requires manufactured homes to be properly anchored. Many carriers require proof of a compliant tie-down system—and some offer discounts for certified installations.

- **Roof condition:** Metal roofs typically get better rates than shingle roofs. A newer roof improves your insurability significantly.

- **Overall condition:** Visible maintenance issues, skirting condition, and utility connections all factor into an insurer's decision.

## How to Decide

If you're having trouble finding mobile home coverage or want better rates:

- **Document your tie-downs:** If you have a tie-down installation certificate from a licensed contractor, keep it handy. If not, getting a certification can help.
- **Consider roof updates:** If your roof is older or in poor condition, a new metal roof can improve both your insurability and your rates.
- **Shop with an independent agent:** We work with multiple carriers, including those that specialize in manufactured homes. We can often find coverage when others can't.
