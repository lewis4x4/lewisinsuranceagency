## Short Answer

Standard homeowners insurance policies specifically exclude flood damage. This is true for all homeowners policies, not just in Florida. If you want protection against flood damage to your home and belongings, you need a separate flood insurance policy—either through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a private flood insurer.

## Why It Matters in Florida

Florida experiences more flooding than almost any other state. Heavy rainstorms, tropical systems, storm surge, and poor drainage can all cause flooding—even in areas not designated as high-risk flood zones.

Many homeowners assume their policy covers "water damage," but there's a critical distinction:

**What homeowners insurance typically covers:**
- Water damage from a burst pipe inside your home
- Rain coming through a hole in your roof created by wind
- Overflow from appliances like washing machines

**What requires flood insurance:**
- Rising water from outside entering your home
- Storm surge from hurricanes
- Overflow of rivers, lakes, or drainage systems
- Mudflow

The damage may look similar, but the cause determines which policy pays.

## How to Decide

When thinking about flood insurance, consider:

- **Your flood zone:** Even if you're in a lower-risk zone (Zone X), flooding can still happen. Many flood claims come from outside high-risk areas.
- **Your mortgage:** If you have a federally-backed mortgage in a high-risk flood zone, flood insurance is required. But even if it's not required, it may be wise.
- **Waiting period:** There's typically a 30-day waiting period before a new flood policy takes effect, so you can't wait until a storm is approaching.

We can help you understand your flood risk and compare NFIP vs. private flood options. Private flood insurance often provides more coverage at competitive rates.
