## The Simple Answer

A wind mitigation inspection documents how well your home is built to withstand hurricane-force winds. Florida law requires insurance companies to give you discounts if your home has certain wind-resistant features. One $75–$150 inspection can save you hundreds—sometimes thousands—on your annual premium.

## Features & Benefits

| Wind Mitigation Feature | Potential Discount |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Hip roof (vs. gable) | 3%–8% |
| Roof deck attachment (8d nails, proper spacing) | 5%–15% |
| Roof-to-wall connections (clips, straps, wraps) | 15%–45% |
| Secondary water resistance | 2%–10% |
| Opening protection (shutters, impact windows) | 5%–45% |
| Roof covering (FBC-compliant, age) | Varies |

**Why This Matters:**
- Most Florida homeowners qualify for some discount
- Newer homes (2002+) often get significant credits automatically
- Older homes with upgrades can qualify too
- Discounts are required by law—insurers must honor them
- Inspection is valid for 5 years
