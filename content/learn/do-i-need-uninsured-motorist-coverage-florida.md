## Short Answer

Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage is optional in Florida, but strongly recommended. It pays for your injuries and damages when you're hit by a driver who has no insurance or flees the scene. Given Florida's high rate of uninsured drivers, this coverage can be essential protection.

## Why It Matters in Florida

Florida is a no-fault state with PIP (Personal Injury Protection) as the required coverage—but PIP only covers $10,000 of your medical bills regardless of fault. If you're seriously injured by an uninsured driver, PIP may not come close to covering your expenses.

That's where uninsured motorist coverage comes in. It fills the gap when the at-fault driver either has no insurance or doesn't have enough insurance to pay for your injuries and losses.

Florida consistently ranks among the states with the highest percentage of uninsured drivers. When you're sharing the road with drivers who may have no coverage, UM protection becomes more valuable.

## How to Decide

When deciding on uninsured motorist coverage, consider:

- **Your health insurance situation:** If you have strong health coverage, your exposure may be lower—but UM also covers lost wages and pain and suffering that health insurance doesn't.
- **Your assets:** If you'd have to pay medical bills and lost income out of pocket, UM provides important protection.
- **Stacking:** Florida allows you to "stack" UM coverage across multiple vehicles on your policy, multiplying your protection.
