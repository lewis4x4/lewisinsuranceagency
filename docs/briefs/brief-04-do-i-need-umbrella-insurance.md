# "Do I Really Need Umbrella Insurance?"

## The Simple Answer

If you have assets worth protecting—a home, savings, retirement accounts—umbrella insurance is one of the smartest purchases you can make. It adds an extra layer of liability protection on top of your auto and homeowners policies, kicking in when those limits run out.
