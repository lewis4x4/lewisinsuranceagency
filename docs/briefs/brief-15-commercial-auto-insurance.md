# "What is Commercial Auto Insurance and Do I Need It?"

## The Simple Answer

If you use a vehicle for business—deliveries, client visits, hauling equipment, or transporting employees—your personal auto policy probably won't cover an accident. Commercial auto insurance protects your business vehicles, your employees who drive them, and your company from liability.

| Liability | Bodily injury and property damage you cause to others |

## What Our Clients Say

> "I thought my personal policy covered my work truck. When I got in an accident making a delivery, they denied the claim. Lewis set me up with commercial auto and I'll never make that mistake again."
> — **Danny R., Lake City (HVAC Contractor)**

> "My employee hit someone while driving the company van. The lawsuit named me personally. Commercial auto covered everything—defense costs, settlement, all of it."
> — **Barbara K., Gainesville (Cleaning Service Owner)**

> "Lewis saved me $1,200 a year by bundling my three work trucks under one commercial policy. Better coverage and lower cost than insuring them separately."
