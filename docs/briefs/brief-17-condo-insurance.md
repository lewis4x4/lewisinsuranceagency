# "What Insurance Do I Need for My Condo?"

## The Simple Answer

Your condo association's master policy covers the building structure, but not your unit's interior, your belongings, or your liability. You need an HO-6 condo policy to protect everything from your walls in—flooring, cabinets, appliances, furniture, and personal items. Without it, you're exposed.

## Features & Benefits

| What Condo Insurance Covers | What It Doesn't Cover |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Interior walls, flooring, fixtures | Building exterior (master policy) |
| Personal belongings | Common areas (master policy) |
| Built-in appliances and cabinets | Other unit owners' property |
| Liability if someone is injured | Flood damage (separate policy) |
| Additional living expenses | HOA deductible (unless you add loss assessment) |
| Improvements and upgrades you've made | Earthquake damage (rare in FL) |
| Loss assessment coverage (optional) | |

**Why You Can't Rely on the Master Policy:**
- Master policies typically cover "studs out" or "bare walls"
- You're responsible for everything inside your unit
- Your upgrades (granite counters, wood floors) aren't covered
- If the HOA's deductible is $50,000, you may be assessed your share
- Liability coverage protects YOU, not the association

## What Our Clients Say

> "A pipe burst in my condo and destroyed my floors and kitchen cabinets. The HOA's insurance covered the building, but I was responsible for $18,000 in interior repairs. My HO-6 policy from Lewis covered everything."
> — **Catherine L., Gainesville**

> "My neighbor's bathtub overflowed and water came through my ceiling. His insurance didn't cover my damage—mine did. Lewis made sure I had the right coverage from day one."
> — **James H., Lake City**

> "I had no idea I needed loss assessment coverage until Lewis explained that the HOA could charge me thousands if there's a major claim. Added it for less than $50 a year."
> — **Margaret S., Alachua**
