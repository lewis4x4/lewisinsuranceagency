# "What is Workers' Compensation Insurance and Does My Business Need It?"

## The Simple Answer

Workers' compensation covers medical bills and lost wages when an employee gets hurt on the job. In Florida, most businesses with four or more employees are required by law to carry it. Construction companies need it with just one employee. Without it, you're personally liable—and breaking the law.
