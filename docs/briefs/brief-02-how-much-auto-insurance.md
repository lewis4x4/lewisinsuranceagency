# "How Much Auto Insurance Do I Actually Need in Florida?"

## The Simple Answer

Florida law requires only $10,000 in Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and $10,000 in Property Damage Liability. That's the legal minimum—but it's not nearly enough to protect you. One serious accident could cost you everything you own.

## What Our Clients Say

> "I thought minimum coverage was fine until Lewis explained what would happen if I caused a serious accident. For an extra $40 a month, I have real protection now. Peace of mind is worth it."
> — **Kevin M., Lake City**

> "My son rear-ended someone and the other driver's medical bills were over $45,000. Thank God Lewis had set us up with proper bodily injury coverage. The state minimum would have ruined us financially."
> — **Sandra W., High Springs**

> "I got hit by an uninsured driver on I-75. Because Lewis recommended uninsured motorist coverage, my medical bills and car repairs were covered. I'd be out $18,000 otherwise."
> — **Marcus D., Gainesville**
