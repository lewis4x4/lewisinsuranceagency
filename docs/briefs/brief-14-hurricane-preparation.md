# "How Do I Prepare My Home for Hurricane Season?"

## The Simple Answer

Preparation happens before the storm, not when it's in the Gulf. Review your insurance coverage now, document your belongings, secure your property, and have a plan. The time to find out you're underinsured is not when you're filing a claim.
