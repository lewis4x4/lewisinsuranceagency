# "What is a Deductible and How Does It Affect My Premium?"

## The Simple Answer

A deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in. Higher deductible = lower premium. Lower deductible = higher premium. In Florida, you'll have a regular deductible and a separate hurricane deductible—and they work differently.

## Features & Benefits

| Deductible Type | How It Works | Typical Amounts |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Standard Deductible | Flat dollar amount per claim (fire, theft, etc.) | $500–$2,500 |
| Hurricane Deductible | Percentage of your home's insured value | 2%–10% of dwelling coverage |
| Auto Collision | Flat amount for damage to your car | $250–$1,000 |
| Auto Comprehensive | Flat amount for theft, weather, animals | $100–$500 |

**Hurricane Deductible Example:**
- Home insured for $300,000
- 2% hurricane deductible = $6,000 out of pocket
- 5% hurricane deductible = $15,000 out of pocket

**The Trade-Off:**
- Higher deductibles can save 10%–25% on your premium
- But you need cash available when a claim happens
- Choose a deductible you can actually afford to pay

> "I didn't realize my hurricane deductible was 5% until a storm hit. That was $12,000 out of my pocket. Lewis helped me understand the difference and adjust it to something I could handle."
> — **Patricia G., Lake City**

> "Lewis showed me that raising my standard deductible from $1,000 to $2,500 would save me $380 a year. I put that savings in a separate account for emergencies. Smart move."
> — **John and Karen P., Gainesville**

> "I thought all deductibles were the same. Lewis explained that my hurricane deductible only applies once per season, no matter how many storms hit. Little details like that matter."
