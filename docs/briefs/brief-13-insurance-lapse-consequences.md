# "What Happens If I Let My Insurance Policy Lapse?"

## The Simple Answer

Nothing good. A lapse in coverage—even for one day—can cost you more than you saved. Your mortgage company can force-place expensive insurance, your car becomes illegal to drive, and future insurers will charge you more because a lapse signals risk. Don't let it happen.

## Features & Benefits

| Type of Lapse | Consequences |
|---------------|--------------|
| Auto Insurance | License suspension, registration revoked, fines, SR-22 requirement, higher future premiums |
| Homeowners Insurance | Mortgage lender force-places costly coverage, claim denial, policy cancellation |
| Flood Insurance | 30-day waiting period before new coverage starts, no coverage during that time |
| Business Insurance | Contract violations, inability to operate, personal liability exposure |

**The Real Costs of a Lapse:**
- Force-placed insurance costs 2–3x more than regular coverage
- Florida DMV can suspend your license for auto insurance lapse
- Reinstatement fees and SR-22 filings add hundreds in costs
- New insurers charge 20%–40% more after any lapse
- You're 100% liable for any accidents or damage during the gap
