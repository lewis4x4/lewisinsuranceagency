# "Does My Homeowners Insurance Cover My Home-Based Business?"

## The Simple Answer

Probably not. Most homeowners policies exclude or severely limit coverage for business activities conducted at home. Your business equipment, inventory, and liability from client visits likely aren't covered. A claim denial could cost you everything you've built.
