# Florida Homeowners Insurance Guide

*Last Updated: December 2024*

Protecting your home in the Sunshine State comes with unique challenges. From hurricane season to year-round humidity, Florida homeowners face risks that residents in other states simply don't encounter. This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about homeowners insurance in Florida—what it covers, what it doesn't, how much it costs, and how to find the right policy for your situation.

## What Is Homeowners Insurance?

Homeowners insurance is a type of property insurance that protects your home and belongings against damage, theft, and liability claims. In Florida, homeowners insurance is not legally required by the state, but mortgage lenders require it as a condition of your loan. Even if you own your home outright, carrying homeowners insurance protects your largest financial investment.

A standard Florida homeowners insurance policy typically includes several types of coverage bundled together. Understanding each component helps you make informed decisions about your coverage limits and deductibles.

## What Does Florida Homeowners Insurance Cover?

### Dwelling Coverage (Coverage A)

Dwelling coverage pays to repair or rebuild your home's structure if it's damaged by a covered peril. This includes:

- The main structure of your home
- Attached structures (garage, deck, porch)
- Built-in appliances
- Plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems
- Roofing

**Florida-Specific Note**: Dwelling coverage in Florida policies typically covers wind damage, but many carriers exclude or limit hurricane and windstorm coverage. You may need a separate windstorm policy or endorsement, especially in coastal areas.

### Other Structures Coverage (Coverage B)

This covers detached structures on your property, such as:

- Detached garage
- Shed or storage building
- Fence
- Pool house
- Gazebo

Coverage B typically equals 10% of your dwelling coverage amount. If your home is insured for $400,000, other structures coverage would be $40,000.

### Personal Property Coverage (Coverage C)

Personal property coverage protects your belongings inside the home, including:

- Furniture
- Electronics
- Clothing
- Appliances
- Sporting equipment

Most policies provide coverage equal to 50-70% of your dwelling coverage. High-value items like jewelry, art, and collectibles may have sub-limits and require scheduled personal property endorsements for full protection.

### Loss of Use Coverage (Coverage D)

If your home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered loss, loss of use coverage pays for:

- Temporary housing (hotel, rental home)
- Increased living expenses
- Restaurant meals above normal food costs
- Storage fees

This coverage is especially important in Florida, where hurricane damage can displace families for months during repairs.

### Personal Liability Coverage (Coverage E)

Liability coverage protects you if someone is injured on your property or if you accidentally damage someone else's property. This includes:

- Medical expenses for injured guests
- Legal defense costs
- Court judgments against you
- Damage you cause to others' property

Standard policies provide $100,000 to $300,000 in liability coverage. Florida homeowners with pools, trampolines, or dogs should consider higher limits or an umbrella policy.

### Medical Payments Coverage (Coverage F)

Medical payments coverage pays for minor injuries to guests regardless of fault. This prevents small incidents from becoming lawsuits. Coverage typically ranges from $1,000 to $5,000 per person.

## What Florida Homeowners Insurance Does NOT Cover

Understanding exclusions is just as important as knowing what's covered. Standard Florida homeowners policies exclude:

### Flood Damage

**This is critical for Florida homeowners.** Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage—period. Flooding from:

- Storm surge
- Rising water
- Overflowing rivers or lakes
- Heavy rainfall accumulation

All require a separate flood insurance policy. Given Florida's geography, most homeowners should carry flood insurance regardless of whether they're in a designated flood zone.

### Earth Movement

Damage from sinkholes, earthquakes, and soil settling is typically excluded. Florida has significant sinkhole activity, particularly in central Florida. Sinkhole coverage can be added as an endorsement.

### Gradual Damage

Insurance covers sudden, accidental damage—not gradual deterioration. Excluded damage includes:

- Mold from long-term humidity
- Termite and pest damage
- Wear and tear
- Rust and corrosion
- Rot from moisture

### Maintenance Issues

If damage results from deferred maintenance, your claim may be denied. Examples include:

- Roof leaks from aging shingles you didn't replace
- Water damage from a slow pipe leak you ignored
- Foundation issues from improper drainage

### Certain Dog Breeds

Some insurers exclude or limit coverage for specific dog breeds they consider high-risk. Check your policy if you own breeds like Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, or German Shepherds.

## How Much Does Homeowners Insurance Cost in Florida?

Florida has some of the highest homeowners insurance rates in the nation. The average annual premium in Florida exceeds $4,000—more than double the national average.

### Factors That Affect Your Premium

**Location**: Coastal properties cost significantly more to insure than inland homes. Proximity to fire stations and hydrants also matters.

**Home Age and Construction**: Newer homes built to current Florida Building Code standards cost less to insure. Block construction is preferred over frame in hurricane-prone areas.

**Roof Age and Material**: Your roof is the single biggest factor in Florida homeowners insurance pricing. A roof over 15 years old may be difficult to insure at all. Metal and tile roofs often qualify for discounts.

**Coverage Limits**: Higher dwelling coverage and lower deductibles increase premiums.

**Claims History**: Previous claims—even at other properties—can increase your rates.

**Credit Score**: Most Florida insurers use credit-based insurance scores in pricing.

**Protective Devices**: Security systems, smoke detectors, and water leak sensors can reduce premiums.

### Wind Mitigation Discounts

Florida law requires insurers to offer discounts for wind mitigation features. A wind mitigation inspection documents features like:

- Roof shape (hip roofs perform better)
- Roof covering (FBC-approved materials)
- Roof deck attachment (nails vs. staples)
- Roof-to-wall connections (hurricane straps/clips)
- Opening protection (hurricane shutters, impact windows)
- Secondary water resistance

A wind mitigation inspection costs $75-150 and can save hundreds or even thousands annually on premiums. Every Florida homeowner should get one.

### 4-Point Inspection

For homes over 20-30 years old, insurers require a 4-point inspection examining:

1. Roof
2. Electrical system
3. Plumbing
4. HVAC

This inspection identifies potential hazards and helps insurers assess risk. Some older homes may be declined coverage if these systems haven't been updated.

## Types of Homeowners Insurance Policies

### HO-3 (Special Form)

The most common policy type. Covers your dwelling against all perils except those specifically excluded. Personal property is covered on a named-perils basis.

### HO-5 (Comprehensive Form)

Premium coverage that protects both dwelling and personal property on an open-perils basis. Fewer exclusions mean broader protection.

### HO-6 (Condo Insurance)

Designed for condominium owners. Covers your unit's interior, personal property, and liability. The condo association's master policy covers common areas and the building exterior.

### HO-8 (Older Home Form)

For historic or older homes where replacement cost exceeds market value. Pays actual cash value rather than replacement cost.

### DP-3 (Dwelling Fire Policy)

Often used for rental properties or when traditional HO-3 coverage is unavailable. More limited coverage than HO-3.

---

## Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value

Understanding how your policy pays claims is crucial:

**Replacement Cost**: Pays to replace damaged items with new equivalents. If a 10-year-old roof is destroyed, you get a new roof.

**Actual Cash Value (ACV)**: Pays replacement cost minus depreciation. That 10-year-old roof might only pay out 50% of replacement cost.

Most Florida homeowners should carry replacement cost coverage, especially for the dwelling. ACV policies are cheaper but leave you underinsured after a major loss.

---

## Florida-Specific Insurance Considerations

### Hurricane Deductibles

Florida policies have separate hurricane or wind/hail deductibles, typically calculated as a percentage of your dwelling coverage:

- 2% deductible on $400,000 home = $8,000 out of pocket
- 5% deductible on $400,000 home = $20,000 out of pocket

Choosing a higher hurricane deductible lowers your premium but increases your financial exposure during a storm. Consider your savings and risk tolerance when selecting this deductible.

### Citizens Property Insurance

Citizens is Florida's state-run insurer of last resort. If you can't find coverage in the private market, Citizens provides an option. However, Citizens policies:

- Often cost more than private alternatives
- Come with coverage limitations
- Assess policyholders statewide after major hurricanes

Always shop the private market before defaulting to Citizens.

### Assignment of Benefits (AOB)

AOB allows you to sign over your insurance benefits to a contractor. While convenient, AOB abuse has contributed to Florida's insurance crisis. Be cautious about signing AOB agreements and always involve your insurance company in the claims process.

## How to Save on Florida Homeowners Insurance

1. **Get a wind mitigation inspection** — Often provides the largest discount
2. **Bundle with auto insurance** — Multi-policy discounts of 5-25%
3. **Increase your deductible** — Higher deductibles mean lower premiums
4. **Improve your roof** — A new roof can dramatically reduce rates
5. **Install protective devices** — Security systems, water sensors, hurricane shutters
6. **Maintain good credit** — Pay bills on time, reduce debt
7. **Shop around annually** — Florida's market changes frequently
8. **Ask about all available discounts** — New home, claims-free, loyalty

## How to File a Homeowners Insurance Claim

### Immediate Steps After Damage

1. **Ensure safety first** — Don't enter unsafe structures
2. **Document everything** — Photos, videos, written inventory
3. **Prevent further damage** — Temporary repairs are covered
4. **Contact your insurance company** — Report claims promptly
5. **Keep receipts** — All expenses related to the loss

### Working With Adjusters

Your insurance company will send an adjuster to assess damage. You can also hire a public adjuster to represent your interests, though they charge a percentage of your settlement (typically 10-15%).

### Claim Timeline

Florida law requires insurers to:
- Acknowledge claims within 14 days
- Begin investigation within 45 days
- Pay or deny claims within 90 days

Hurricane claims may have extended timelines due to volume.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is homeowners insurance required in Florida?

Florida does not legally require homeowners insurance. However, mortgage lenders require coverage as a loan condition. Even without a mortgage, insurance protects your investment.

### Why is Florida homeowners insurance so expensive?

Florida's high rates result from hurricane exposure, frequent claims, litigation costs, and fraud. The state's insurance market has seen multiple carrier failures, reducing competition and increasing prices.

### Does homeowners insurance cover hurricane damage?

Standard policies cover wind damage from hurricanes, but flood damage requires separate flood insurance. Hurricane deductibles are higher than standard deductibles.

### How much homeowners insurance do I need?

Your dwelling coverage should equal the cost to rebuild your home (not market value). Get a replacement cost estimate from your insurer or an independent appraiser.

### Can I be dropped by my homeowners insurance?

Yes. Florida insurers can non-renew policies, especially for older roofs or multiple claims. You'll receive advance notice and can shop for new coverage.

### What's the difference between named-perils and open-perils coverage?

Named-perils coverage only pays for damage from listed causes. Open-perils coverage pays for all damage except specific exclusions—providing broader protection.

### Do I need flood insurance if I'm not in a flood zone?

Over 25% of flood claims come from outside high-risk zones. Given Florida's flat terrain and heavy rainfall, flood insurance is wise regardless of your zone designation.
