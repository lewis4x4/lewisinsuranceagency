# Top Reason #4: Flood Insurance Is Not Optional in Florida—It's Essential

## Title Statement
**"Your Homeowners Policy Won't Pay for Flood Damage. Period."**

---

## Content Brief

This is the most expensive mistake Florida homeowners make: assuming their homeowners insurance covers flooding. It doesn't. Not even a little. If water comes up from the ground—whether from a storm surge, an overflowing river, or just a really bad rainstorm—your standard policy won't pay a dime.

And here's the thing: you don't have to live on the beach to flood. Some of the worst flood damage in Florida happens miles inland when drainage systems get overwhelmed. Just a few inches of water in your home can cause tens of thousands of dollars in damage to floors, walls, appliances, and furniture.

Since 1981, Lewis Insurance Agency has helped Florida homeowners understand their flood risk and find the right coverage. We work with both the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and private flood insurance carriers. Sometimes NFIP is the better option. Sometimes private insurance offers more coverage for less money. The only way to know is to compare—and that's exactly what we do.

We can also help you understand your flood zone designation, explain what your lender actually requires, and find coverage even if you've been turned down elsewhere. Flood insurance has a 30-day waiting period before it kicks in, so the time to get it is before hurricane season—not the week a storm is heading toward Florida.

Don't wait until it's too late. Flood damage is the most common and costly natural disaster claim in Florida, and it's completely preventable with the right policy.
