# Top Reason #6: Boat Insurance for Florida's Year-Round Boating Lifestyle

## Title Statement
**"Florida Waters Demand More Than a Basic Boat Policy"**

## Content Brief

Florida has more registered boats than any other state in the country. With year-round access to the Gulf, the Atlantic, the Intracoastal, and thousands of lakes and rivers, boating isn't just a hobby here—it's a way of life. But all that time on the water means more exposure to risk, and a cheap boat policy from your auto insurance company probably isn't going to cut it.

Think about what can go wrong: collisions with other boats, hitting submerged objects, theft from the marina, hurricane damage while your boat is stored, injuries to passengers, or someone getting hurt while waterskiing behind you. A real boat insurance policy covers all of that. A basic add-on to your auto policy usually doesn't.

Since 1981, Lewis Insurance Agency has helped Florida boaters find coverage that matches how they actually use their boats. We ask the right questions: Where do you keep it? How far offshore do you go? Do you trailer it or keep it at a marina? Do you use it for fishing, watersports, or cruising? The answers determine what coverage you need and which carriers can offer you the best rates.

We work with marine insurance specialists who understand Florida boating—not general insurers who treat your boat like a car that floats. Whether you have a center console, a pontoon, a sailboat, or a personal watercraft, we'll make sure you're covered for the risks that actually apply to you.

Get out on the water with confidence. Let us handle the insurance part.
