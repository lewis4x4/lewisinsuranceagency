# Top Reason #7: Business Insurance That Protects What You've Built

## Title Statement
**"Your Business Faces Risks Your Personal Policies Don't Cover"**

---

## Content Brief

You've put everything into building your business. Late nights, personal savings, years of hard work. But here's the uncomfortable truth: one lawsuit, one accident, one hurricane, or one cyber attack could wipe out everything you've built if you don't have the right insurance in place.

Personal insurance doesn't protect your business. Your homeowners policy won't cover equipment you use for work. Your auto insurance won't cover accidents in a vehicle used for business purposes. And if someone gets hurt on your property or because of your work, your personal liability coverage won't help.

Since 1981, Lewis Insurance Agency has helped Florida business owners protect their operations with coverage that actually fits their needs. We work with contractors, retailers, restaurants, professional services, and everything in between. We understand general liability, workers' compensation requirements, commercial auto, professional liability, and the newer risks like cyber liability that most businesses ignore until it's too late.

We don't sell you a generic package and call it done. We look at your specific business, your industry, your employees, your equipment, and your exposure. Then we build a coverage plan that protects you without making you pay for things you don't need.

Running a business in Florida is hard enough. Don't let an insurance gap be the thing that takes you down.
