## Content Brief

Mobile homes and manufactured housing are a huge part of Florida's housing market. They're affordable, they're practical, and for many Floridians, they're home. But insuring them isn't as simple as getting a standard homeowners policy—and that's where a lot of people run into trouble.

Mobile homes face unique risks. They're more vulnerable to wind damage. They can shift on their foundations. Older models may not meet current building codes, which affects both coverage availability and cost. And many insurance carriers either don't write mobile home policies at all or charge significantly higher rates because they don't understand the Florida market.

Lewis Insurance Agency has been insuring Florida mobile homes since 1981. We know which carriers specialize in manufactured housing. We understand the difference between coverage for a mobile home on owned land versus in a leased-lot community. We can help you navigate the inspection requirements and find policies that cover your home, your belongings, and your liability without paying for coverage you don't need.

Whether you have a single-wide in a 55+ community, a double-wide on your own property, or a newer modular home, we'll find coverage that fits your situation. And because we work with multiple carriers, we can show you options—not just one company's answer.

Your mobile home deserves real protection from people who actually understand what they're insuring.
