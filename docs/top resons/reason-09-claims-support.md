## Content Brief

Nobody buys insurance hoping to use it. But when you do need it—when a tree falls on your roof, when someone rear-ends you at a red light, when a pipe bursts and floods your kitchen—that's when you find out what your policy and your agent are really worth.

Filing a claim can be confusing and stressful. Insurance companies have processes, paperwork, adjusters, and timelines that most people don't deal with regularly. You're already dealing with damage, disruption, and expenses. The last thing you need is to navigate a claims system alone while worrying whether you're saying the right things or filling out the right forms.

At Lewis Insurance Agency, we don't disappear after we sell you a policy. When you need to file a claim, you call us—the same people who wrote your policy and know your coverage. We help you understand what's covered, what to document, and what to expect from the process. We follow up with carriers when claims drag on. We advocate for you when there's a dispute.

Since 1981, we've helped Florida clients through hurricanes, accidents, thefts, and everything in between. We know how the claims process works because we've been through it thousands of times with our clients. That experience matters when you're sitting in a damaged home wondering what happens next.

Your insurance agent should be your advocate, not just your salesperson. That's the difference between a relationship and a transaction.
