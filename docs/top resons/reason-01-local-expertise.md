## Content Brief

Florida isn't like other states when it comes to insurance. Between hurricane season, flood zones, sinkholes, and rising coastal property values, getting the right coverage requires someone who actually understands what you're up against.

Since 1981, Lewis Insurance Agency has helped Florida homeowners, drivers, and business owners navigate these exact challenges. We've seen carriers come and go. We know which companies pay claims fast after a storm and which ones drag their feet. We understand why your neighbor's flood insurance costs twice as much as yours, and we can explain whether you actually need that sinkhole endorsement.

When you work with a national call center, you're talking to someone reading a script who's never seen a 4-point inspection or dealt with Citizens eligibility requirements. When you call Lewis Insurance, you're talking to agents who live here, insure their own homes here, and have spent decades building relationships with carriers who still write policies in Florida when others have pulled out.

That local knowledge isn't just convenient—it can save you thousands of dollars and a lot of headaches when you actually need to file a claim.
