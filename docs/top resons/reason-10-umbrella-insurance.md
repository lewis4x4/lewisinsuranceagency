# Top Reason #10: Umbrella Insurance Protects Everything Else You've Worked For

## Title Statement
**"Your Regular Policies Have Limits—and Lawsuits Don't"**

## Content Brief

Here's a scenario most people don't think about until it's too late: You're in a car accident and the other driver is seriously injured. Medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering add up to $800,000. Your auto policy has $300,000 in liability coverage. Where does the other $500,000 come from? Your savings. Your home equity. Your retirement accounts. Everything you've spent years building.

This is why umbrella insurance exists. It kicks in when your regular auto, home, or boat policy limits are exhausted. It provides an extra layer of liability protection—typically $1 million or more—that covers you across multiple policies and scenarios.

The surprising part? Umbrella insurance is one of the most affordable types of coverage you can buy. For many Florida families, a $1 million umbrella policy costs less than $300 per year. That's serious protection for what amounts to pocket change compared to the assets you're protecting.

Since 1981, Lewis Insurance Agency has helped Florida families understand when umbrella coverage makes sense. If you own a home, have savings or investments, own a boat, have a pool, employ household staff, or have teenage drivers—you have exposure that your standard policies probably don't fully cover.

We'll look at your current coverage, identify the gaps, and show you what an umbrella policy would cost. For most people, it's one of the smartest insurance decisions they can make.

Don't let one bad day erase a lifetime of work.
