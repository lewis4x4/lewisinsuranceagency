# Top Reason #8: We Work for You, Not the Insurance Company

## Title Statement
**"Independent Agents Compare Options—Captive Agents Sell You Their Company's Policy"**

---

## Content Brief

There are two types of insurance agents in Florida. Captive agents work for one insurance company. They can only sell you that company's products, regardless of whether it's the best fit or the best price. Independent agents like Lewis Insurance work with multiple carriers and can shop your coverage across different companies to find the right match.

This difference matters more than most people realize. When you call a captive agent, you're getting one quote from one company. When you call us, we can compare options from multiple carriers, show you the trade-offs, and help you make an informed decision. If your current carrier raises rates or stops writing policies in your area—something that happens regularly in Florida—we can move you to a different company without starting from scratch.

Lewis Insurance Agency has been operating as an independent agency since 1981. Over the decades, we've built relationships with carriers that specialize in Florida's unique market. Some are better for coastal homes. Some offer better rates for new drivers. Some have faster claims processing. We know which companies are strong in which areas because we've worked with them for years.

You deserve an agent who's on your side of the table. Someone whose job is to find you the best coverage—not to sell you whatever their employer is pushing this quarter. That's what independent means, and that's what you get with Lewis Insurance.
