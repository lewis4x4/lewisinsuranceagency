# Auto Insurance in Lake City, Florida

Lake City sits at the crossroads of I-75 and I-10, making it one of the busiest highway intersections in North Florida. Whether you're commuting to work, hauling equipment to job sites, or just running errands around Columbia County, you need auto insurance that protects you on these high-traffic roads.

## Why Lake City Drivers Need the Right Coverage

Florida's minimum auto insurance requirements—$10,000 in PIP and $10,000 in property damage—won't go far after a serious accident on I-75. With semi-trucks, RVs, and out-of-state travelers passing through constantly, Lake City sees its share of collisions. A basic policy might satisfy the state, but it leaves you exposed when medical bills and repair costs start adding up.

Lewis Insurance Agency has been helping Lake City drivers find better coverage since 1981. We work with multiple carriers to compare rates and find policies that actually protect you—not just the cheapest option that meets minimum requirements.

## Coverage Options for Columbia County Drivers

- **Liability coverage** that protects your assets if you're at fault
- **Collision and comprehensive** for your own vehicle's damage
- **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage** for hit-and-runs and drivers without adequate insurance
- **Medical payments coverage** beyond basic PIP limits
- **Roadside assistance** for breakdowns on rural North Florida roads

## Local Factors That Affect Your Rates

Lake City's location means insurance carriers consider factors like highway exposure, deer crossings on rural roads, and weather events that roll through North Florida. We know which carriers offer competitive rates for Columbia County drivers and which ones to avoid.

If you have teenage drivers, multiple vehicles, or need an SR-22 filing, we can help you find options that won't break the bank.
