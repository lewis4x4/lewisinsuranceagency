# Homeowners Insurance in Macclenny, Florida

Macclenny and Baker County offer affordable housing and growing communities just west of Jacksonville. Whether you've recently built, bought an established home, or have lived here for decades, you need homeowners insurance that accounts for North Florida's weather risks and your property's specific characteristics.

## Understanding Florida Homeowners Coverage

Standard homeowners insurance in Florida includes separate deductibles for hurricane and wind damage. This means when a storm damages your home, you'll pay a percentage of your dwelling coverage—typically 2% to 5%—before insurance kicks in. On a $200,000 home, that's $4,000 to $10,000 out of pocket.

Baker County is inland, so you're not facing the same storm surge risk as coastal communities. But hurricanes, tropical storms, and severe thunderstorms still cause significant damage this far from the coast. Wind, falling trees, and lightning strikes don't stop at the county line.

## What's Covered and What's Not

Your homeowners policy typically covers:

- **Dwelling protection** to repair or rebuild after covered damage
- **Personal property** coverage for furniture, electronics, and belongings
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured on your property
- **Other structures** like detached garages, fences, and sheds
- **Additional living expenses** if you're displaced after a covered loss

Your homeowners policy does not cover flood damage. That requires a separate flood insurance policy. While Baker County has fewer high-risk flood zones than coastal areas, flooding can happen anywhere during heavy rains.
