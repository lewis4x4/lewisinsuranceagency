# Boat Insurance in Jasper, Florida

Hamilton County sits at the confluence of some of North Florida's best waterways. The Alapaha River, Withlacoochee River, and access to the Suwannee River system give Jasper residents easy access to fishing, recreation, and water sports. If you own a boat, you need insurance that protects your investment on these waters.

## Why Jasper Boat Owners Need Coverage

Your homeowners insurance may provide limited coverage for small boats, but it typically has low limits and significant gaps. A dedicated boat insurance policy provides:

- **Hull coverage** for physical damage to your boat
- **Liability protection** if you cause an accident or injury
- **Medical payments** for you and your passengers
- **Uninsured boater coverage** for accidents with boaters who have no insurance
- **Trailer coverage** for your boat trailer
- **Personal property** coverage for fishing equipment, electronics, and gear

## Common Boats We Insure

Lewis Insurance Agency works with carriers who understand North Florida boating. We insure:

- **Bass boats** and fishing boats
- **Jon boats** and aluminum fishing boats
- **Pontoon boats**
- **Center console boats**
- **Kayaks and canoes** (often covered under homeowners, but we can verify)
- **Personal watercraft** (jet skis, wave runners)

## River and Lake Considerations

North Florida rivers have their own risks: submerged logs, changing water levels, limited visibility in tannin-stained water, and remote areas where help may be far away. Your policy should account for where you actually boat, not just the value of your vessel.

If you trailer your boat to different locations—Big Lake Santa Fe, Lake Lochloosa, the St. Johns River, or the Gulf Coast—your coverage should protect you everywhere you go.

## Storage and Off-Season Coverage

Many Hamilton County boat owners store their boats during winter months or between trips. Your insurance should cover damage during storage, whether that's in your yard, a storage facility, or under a carport. Some policies offer reduced rates for declared layup periods.

## Get the Right Coverage

Lewis Insurance Agency serves boat owners throughout Jasper, White Springs, Jennings, and Hamilton County. We understand local waterways and can match you with carriers who offer appropriate coverage at fair rates.
