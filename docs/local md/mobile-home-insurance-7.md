# Mobile Home Insurance in High Springs, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing provide affordable homeownership throughout the High Springs area. Whether you're on a few acres outside town or in a mobile home community, you need insurance that recognizes the specific risks and values of manufactured housing.

## Why Mobile Homes Need Specialized Coverage

Mobile homes face different challenges than site-built houses. They're more vulnerable to wind damage during storms. Older units may not meet current tie-down and anchoring standards. Construction materials and methods differ from traditional homes, affecting both risk profiles and repair costs.

Many insurance carriers either don't write mobile home policies or price them as high-risk by default. Lewis Insurance Agency works with carriers who specialize in manufactured housing and offer competitive rates for North Florida residents.

## What Your Policy Should Cover

A complete mobile home insurance policy includes:

- **Dwelling coverage**: The structure itself, including manufacturer additions and owner improvements
- **Personal property**: Your belongings inside the home
- **Liability protection**: Coverage if someone is injured on your property
- **Other structures**: Carports, storage buildings, and detached structures
- **Additional living expenses**: Temporary housing if your home is damaged and uninhabitable

## Factors That Affect Your Policy

Insurance companies evaluate mobile homes based on several criteria:

- **Year manufactured**: Homes built before 1976 predate HUD construction standards
- **Type**: Single-wide, double-wide, or larger
- **Tie-down and anchoring**: Proper installation reduces wind damage risk
- **Roof condition**: Type, age, and condition affect eligibility and pricing
- **Location factors**: Flood zone, tree proximity, and lot characteristics

If you've been declined by other carriers, talk to us. We often find coverage options where others couldn't.

## Flood Considerations for Mobile Homes

High Springs' proximity to rivers and springs creates flood risk. Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to flood damage, and standard policies don't cover it. Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program or private carriers.

## Protecting Your Investment

Your mobile home may be your largest asset. Proper insurance protects that investment and your family's security.
