# Auto Insurance in Macclenny, Florida

Macclenny is the heart of Baker County, a growing community with easy access to Jacksonville while maintaining its small-town character. Whether you're commuting east on US-90 to work in Jacksonville, driving to Lake City or Gainesville, or just getting around Baker County, you need auto insurance that provides real protection—not just the legal minimum.

## Why Macclenny Drivers Need More Than Minimums

Florida's minimum requirements—$10,000 PIP and $10,000 property damage liability—sound like coverage until you need to use them. A single ER visit can exceed $10,000. A collision with a newer vehicle can easily cost more than your property damage limit allows. When the bills exceed your coverage, you're personally responsible for the difference.

Macclenny's proximity to Jacksonville means you're sharing the road with heavy traffic, commercial vehicles, and out-of-state drivers. I-10 runs just south of town. These factors increase your exposure to accidents that could exceed basic coverage limits.

## Coverage That Fits Your Life

Lewis Insurance Agency has been helping Macclenny drivers since 1981. We work with multiple carriers to compare options and find coverage that actually protects you:

- **Liability coverage** that protects your savings and assets
- **Collision and comprehensive** for your own vehicle
- **Uninsured/underinsured motorist** for accidents with drivers who lack coverage
- **Medical payments** beyond basic PIP limits
- **Roadside assistance** for breakdowns

## Local Factors Matter

Baker County has a mix of rural roads, highway driving, and suburban commutes. We know which carriers offer competitive rates for Macclenny drivers and which ones price this area unfairly. We can also help with multi-car discounts, teenage drivers, SR-22 filings, and coverage for older vehicles.
