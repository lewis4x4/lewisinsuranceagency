# Boat Insurance in Mayo, Florida

Lafayette County sits along the Suwannee River, giving Mayo residents direct access to one of Florida's most scenic and popular waterways. Whether you fish the Suwannee, explore its springs and tributaries, or trailer your boat to the Gulf Coast, you need insurance that protects your investment on the water.

## Why Boat Insurance Matters

Your homeowners policy may provide limited coverage for small boats, but it typically has low limits and doesn't cover many common situations. A dedicated boat insurance policy provides comprehensive protection:

- **Hull coverage**: Physical damage to your boat from accidents, storms, or other covered events
- **Liability protection**: Covers damage you cause to other boats, docks, or injuries to others
- **Medical payments**: Covers medical expenses for you and your passengers
- **Uninsured boater coverage**: Protects you if another boater without insurance injures you or damages your boat
- **Personal property**: Fishing equipment, electronics, and gear on board
- **Trailer coverage**: Protects your boat trailer during transport and storage

## Boats Common in Lafayette County

Lewis Insurance Agency insures all types of recreational watercraft:

- **Bass boats** and fishing boats
- **Jon boats** and aluminum boats
- **Pontoon boats**
- **Flats boats** and shallow-water craft
- **Kayaks and canoes**
- **Personal watercraft** (jet skis)

## Suwannee River Considerations

The Suwannee River system presents specific considerations for boat owners. Tannin-stained water reduces visibility. Water levels change seasonally and after rain events. Submerged logs and debris require vigilance. Remote stretches mean help may be far away if something goes wrong.

Your insurance should account for where you actually boat, not just the theoretical value of your vessel.

## Year-Round and Seasonal Coverage

Some Lafayette County boat owners use their boats year-round. Others store them during winter or between trips. Your policy should cover damage during storage—whether at home, in a storage facility, or under a cover. Some carriers offer reduced rates for declared layup periods when the boat isn't in use.
