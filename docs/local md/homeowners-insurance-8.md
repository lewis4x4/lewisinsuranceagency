# Homeowners Insurance in Gainesville, Florida

Gainesville's housing market ranges from historic homes near downtown to newer developments in the suburbs, from student-oriented properties to family neighborhoods. Whatever type of home you own, protecting that investment requires insurance that addresses North Florida's specific risks.

## Understanding Your Coverage Needs

Standard homeowners insurance in Florida includes separate deductibles for hurricane and wind damage. On a $350,000 home—common in many Gainesville neighborhoods—a 2% hurricane deductible means $7,000 out of pocket before coverage kicks in. These deductibles catch many homeowners off guard after storms.

Your policy should protect:

- **Dwelling coverage**: Your home's structure, including attached garages and porches
- **Other structures**: Detached garages, workshops, storage buildings, and fences
- **Personal property**: Furniture, electronics, appliances, clothing—everything inside
- **Liability protection**: Coverage if someone is injured on your property
- **Additional living expenses**: Temporary housing if your home becomes uninhabitable after a covered loss

## Sinkhole Coverage in Alachua County

Gainesville sits on karst terrain—limestone bedrock that can dissolve over time, creating sinkholes. Standard homeowners policies in Florida only cover catastrophic ground cover collapse, which has a narrow definition. True sinkhole coverage is available as an add-on and worth considering given Alachua County's geology.

If you're buying a home, a sinkhole inspection provides valuable information about ground stability. If you already own, understanding your risk helps you make informed coverage decisions.

## Flood Risk

While Gainesville isn't coastal, flood risk exists—particularly near Paynes Prairie, low-lying areas, and properties near creeks and retention ponds. Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. If your lender requires flood insurance, you're in a designated flood zone. Even outside high-risk zones, flooding can happen anywhere.

## Older Homes and Historic Properties

Gainesville has significant housing stock built before modern construction standards. These homes often have character and location advantages but may require inspections before carriers will write policies:

- **4-Point Inspection**: Evaluates roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems
- **Wind Mitigation Inspection**: Documents hurricane-resistant features for potential discounts

Older electrical systems, galvanized plumbing, and aging roofs affect both eligibility and pricing. We know which carriers work best with Gainesville's older homes.

## Investment and Rental Properties

If you own rental property or investment homes near the university, you need landlord insurance—not standard homeowners. Landlord policies address different risks and provide appropriate coverage for tenant-occupied properties.
