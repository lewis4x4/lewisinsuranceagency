# Business Insurance in Macclenny, Florida

Macclenny's growth as a Jacksonville suburb has brought new businesses while established local companies continue serving Baker County. From contractors and service providers to retail shops and restaurants along US-90, the local economy depends on businesses that need proper insurance protection.

## Your Personal Policies Don't Cover Business

This trips up many Macclenny business owners. Your homeowners insurance won't cover equipment used for your business. Your personal auto policy excludes accidents in vehicles used for commercial purposes. If a customer or employee gets hurt because of your operations, your personal liability coverage won't help.

Business insurance exists specifically to protect your commercial activities—your equipment, vehicles, employees, and exposure to lawsuits that personal policies exclude.

- **Transportation and trucking** — commercial auto, cargo, physical damage
- **Professional services** — errors and omissions, cyber liability
- **Agriculture and farms** — equipment, liability, specialty coverage
- **Service businesses** — general liability, commercial auto, bonding

## Essential Coverage Types
