# Homeowners Insurance in Mayo, Florida

Mayo homeowners enjoy some of the most affordable property in Florida. Lafayette County offers space, privacy, and a rural lifestyle that's increasingly rare. But affordable doesn't mean without risk—North Florida weather, liability exposures, and the unexpected can still threaten your home and your finances.

## What Your Policy Needs to Cover

Standard homeowners insurance in Florida typically includes separate deductibles for hurricane and wind damage. Even on a modestly valued home, a 2% hurricane deductible means thousands out of pocket before your coverage kicks in.

Your policy should protect:

- **Dwelling**: The structure of your home, including attached structures
- **Other structures**: Detached garages, barns, workshops, and storage buildings
- **Personal property**: Everything inside your home—furniture, appliances, clothing, electronics
- **Liability**: Protection if someone is injured on your property or if you accidentally damage someone else's property
- **Additional living expenses**: Covers temporary housing if your home becomes uninhabitable

## Flood Risk in Lafayette County

Lafayette County borders the Suwannee River and has extensive flood-prone areas. Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage—that requires a separate flood insurance policy. If your lender requires flood insurance, you're in a high-risk zone. But even if you're not, flood damage can happen to any property, and federal disaster aid is rarely adequate to rebuild.

Lewis Insurance Agency can help you evaluate your flood risk and find coverage if you need it.

## Older Homes and Inspections

Many Lafayette County homes are older and may require inspections before carriers will write a policy:

- **4-Point Inspection**: Evaluates roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC
- **Wind Mitigation Inspection**: Documents features that may qualify you for discounts

Some carriers are more flexible with older homes than others. We know which ones to approach based on your home's age and condition.
