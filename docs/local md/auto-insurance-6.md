# Auto Insurance in Mayo, Florida

Mayo serves as the county seat of Lafayette County, Florida's least populous county. Living here means you're part of a tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone—and where driving is essential for daily life. Whether you're commuting to Perry, Live Oak, or Cross City for work, or traveling to larger cities for services not available locally, you need auto insurance that provides real protection.

## Coverage for Lafayette County Drivers

Florida's minimum auto insurance—$10,000 PIP and $10,000 property damage—barely qualifies as coverage. One emergency room visit can exhaust your PIP. One collision with a newer vehicle can exceed your property damage limits. When your coverage runs out, collectors come after your paycheck and your property.

Lafayette County's rural roads present unique driving conditions: deer are everywhere, especially at dawn and dusk; farm equipment and timber trucks share the roads; many stretches have no cell service; and emergency response times can be significant. Your insurance should reflect where and how you actually drive.

## What We Can Do for You

Lewis Insurance Agency has been helping Mayo drivers since 1981. As an independent agency, we work with multiple carriers to find coverage that fits:

- **Liability coverage** that protects your assets, not just meets minimum requirements
- **Collision coverage** for damage to your vehicle in an accident
- **Comprehensive coverage** for theft, vandalism, deer strikes, and weather damage
- **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage** for accidents with drivers who have no or inadequate insurance
- **Medical payments coverage** that supplements your PIP
- **Roadside assistance** that makes sense for rural driving conditions

## Finding Affordable Coverage

Some insurance companies avoid writing policies in small, rural counties. Others compete aggressively for this business. We know which carriers offer fair rates for Lafayette County drivers and which ones to avoid.

If you have multiple vehicles, a clean driving record, or can bundle with homeowners insurance, you may qualify for significant discounts. We'll explore every option.

## Local Agents, Not a Call Center

Lewis Insurance Agency serves Mayo, Day, and all of Lafayette County. We're local agents who understand this community—not a 1-800 number in another state reading from a script.

Call us for an auto insurance quote. We'll show you what's available and help you make an informed decision.
