# Mobile Home Insurance in Macclenny, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing provide affordable homeownership throughout Baker County. From established communities to private land, manufactured homes are a practical choice for many Macclenny area families. But insuring them requires specialized knowledge that not every agent has.

## Mobile Homes Are Different

Mobile homes face risks that site-built homes don't. They're more vulnerable to wind damage during severe storms. Older units may not meet current anchoring and tie-down standards. The construction methods differ from traditional homes, which affects both coverage options and pricing.

Many insurance carriers either refuse to write mobile home policies or charge inflated rates because they don't understand the market. Lewis Insurance Agency has been insuring Macclenny mobile homes since 1981. We work with carriers who specialize in manufactured housing and treat mobile home owners fairly.

## Coverage for Your Manufactured Home

Whether you have a single-wide, double-wide, or modular home, we can find coverage that fits:

- **Dwelling coverage** for the structure at replacement cost
- **Personal property** protection for belongings inside
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured at your home
- **Other structures** for porches, carports, and outbuildings
- **Additional living expenses** if you need temporary housing

## Your Land or Leased Space

Coverage needs differ depending on whether your mobile home sits on land you own or in a community where you lease the lot. We'll make sure you have the right coverage for your situation—and that you're not paying for things you don't need.

## Older Mobile Homes Accepted

Some carriers won't insure mobile homes older than 20 or 30 years. Others require specific improvements before they'll write a policy. We work with companies that understand older manufactured homes and can often find coverage when other agents have turned you down.
