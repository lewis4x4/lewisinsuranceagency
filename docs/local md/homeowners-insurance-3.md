# Homeowners Insurance in Branford, Florida

Branford's location along the Suwannee River makes it one of the most scenic communities in North Florida. It also means many homeowners face flood risk that requires careful attention when purchasing insurance. Whether your home overlooks the river or sits on higher ground in town, you need coverage designed for this area's specific risks.

## River Community Insurance Needs

If you live near the Suwannee River, flood insurance isn't optional—it's essential. Your standard homeowners policy does not cover flood damage, period. When the river rises, homeowners without flood coverage face devastating losses with no help from their insurance company.

Even if your home isn't in a designated flood zone, Branford's proximity to the river means you should seriously consider flood protection. Some of the worst flood damage happens to homes that were supposedly outside high-risk areas.

## What Homeowners Insurance Covers

Your standard homeowners policy protects against many risks, but not all. Here's what's typically covered:

- **Dwelling coverage** to repair or rebuild your home after covered damage
- **Personal property** protection for furniture, appliances, and belongings
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured on your property
- **Other structures** like detached garages, sheds, and fences
- **Additional living expenses** if you're displaced after a covered loss

Florida policies include separate hurricane and wind deductibles—typically 2% to 5% of your dwelling coverage. Make sure you understand what you'll pay out of pocket before a claim.
