# Mobile Home Insurance in Gainesville, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing provide affordable housing options throughout the Gainesville area. From mobile home communities to acreage outside the city, manufactured housing serves students, families, retirees, and everyone in between. Insuring these homes requires working with an agent who understands manufactured housing.

## Why Mobile Homes Need Specialized Coverage

Mobile homes face different risks than site-built houses. They're more vulnerable to wind damage during severe weather. Construction materials and methods differ from traditional homes. Older units may not meet current tie-down standards or HUD requirements.

Many insurance carriers either avoid mobile homes or price them assuming worst-case scenarios. Lewis Insurance Agency works with carriers who specialize in manufactured housing and offer competitive rates for Alachua County residents.

## What Your Policy Should Cover

A complete mobile home insurance policy includes:

- **Dwelling coverage**: The structure, including any additions or improvements you've made
- **Personal property**: Your belongings inside the home
- **Liability protection**: Coverage if someone is injured on your property
- **Other structures**: Carports, storage buildings, and detached structures
- **Additional living expenses**: Temporary housing if your home becomes uninhabitable

## Factors That Affect Coverage and Pricing

Insurance companies evaluate mobile homes based on:

- **Year manufactured**: Pre-1976 homes were built before HUD construction standards
- **Construction type**: Single-wide, double-wide, or multi-section
- **Tie-down and anchoring**: Proper installation affects wind damage risk
- **Roof condition**: Age, type, and overall condition
- **Location**: Flood zone status, tree proximity, community type

If you've been declined elsewhere, talk to us. We often find options where other agents couldn't.

## Sinkhole and Flood Considerations

Alachua County's karst geology creates sinkhole risk throughout the region. Standard mobile home policies typically don't cover sinkhole damage—additional coverage may be available depending on your carrier.

Flood damage is also excluded from standard policies. If you're in or near a flood zone, separate flood insurance is essential.

## Mobile Home Communities and Private Land

Coverage requirements and options may differ based on whether your mobile home is in a community or on private land. Community policies may include some shared coverage. Homes on private land may need broader coverage for additional structures and land improvements.
