# Boat Insurance in High Springs, Florida

High Springs is the gateway to some of Florida's most beautiful waterways. The Santa Fe River, Ichetucknee River, and numerous first-magnitude springs draw paddlers, tubers, fishermen, and boaters from across the state. If you own a boat or watercraft, you need insurance that protects your investment on these waters.

## Why Boat Owners Need Dedicated Coverage

Your homeowners insurance may provide limited coverage for small boats, but it typically has low limits and significant exclusions. A dedicated boat insurance policy provides:

- **Hull coverage**: Physical damage to your boat from accidents, storms, sinking, or other covered events
- **Liability protection**: Covers damage to other boats, docks, or injuries you cause
- **Medical payments**: Medical expenses for you and your passengers
- **Uninsured boater coverage**: Protection if another boater without insurance causes damage or injury
- **Personal property**: Fishing equipment, electronics, coolers, and gear
- **Trailer coverage**: Your boat trailer during transport and storage

## Watercraft We Insure

Lewis Insurance Agency works with carriers who understand recreational boating in North Florida. We insure:

- **Bass boats** and fishing boats
- **Jon boats** and aluminum craft
- **Pontoon boats**
- **Canoes and kayaks** (often covered under homeowners, but we can verify limits)
- **Paddleboards and inflatables**
- **Personal watercraft** (jet skis, wave runners)

## River-Specific Considerations

North Florida rivers have characteristics that differ from lakes or coastal waters. Tannic water reduces visibility. Submerged logs and limestone outcroppings require attention. Water levels fluctuate seasonally and after rain events. Some stretches are remote with limited cell service.

Your insurance should account for where you actually use your boat—not just its value sitting in your driveway.

## Coverage for Different Use Patterns

Some High Springs boat owners use their boats year-round on local rivers. Others trailer to different destinations—the Gulf Coast, Lake Santa Fe, or the St. Johns River system. Your policy should cover you wherever you go.

If you store your boat during off-seasons or between trips, your coverage should protect against damage during storage—whether at home, in a facility, or under a cover.
