# Homeowners Insurance in Live Oak, Florida

Live Oak homeowners enjoy the benefits of small-town North Florida living—affordable housing, space to spread out, and a close-knit community. But owning a home in Suwannee County comes with risks that your insurance needs to address, from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes to flooding along the Suwannee River.

## Understanding Your Coverage Needs

Standard homeowners insurance in Florida includes separate deductibles for hurricane and wind damage. This catches many homeowners off guard when they file a claim after a storm. On a $200,000 home, a 2% hurricane deductible means $4,000 out of pocket before coverage kicks in.

Live Oak also has flood risk areas, particularly near the Suwannee River and its tributaries. Your homeowners policy does not cover flood damage—that requires a separate flood insurance policy. If you're in a flood zone, your lender may require it. Even if you're not, flood damage can happen anywhere.

## Coverage for Suwannee County Homes

Lewis Insurance Agency has been protecting Live Oak homes since 1981. We understand the local housing market—older craftsman homes in town, newer construction in subdivisions, manufactured homes, and rural properties on acreage. Different homes need different coverage approaches.

We work with carriers who actively write policies in Suwannee County and offer:

- **Dwelling coverage** at replacement cost to rebuild your home
- **Personal property protection** for furniture, appliances, and belongings
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured on your property
- **Other structures** coverage for detached garages, barns, and outbuildings
- **Additional living expenses** if you're displaced after a covered loss

## Older Homes and Rural Properties

If your home is older, some carriers require updated electrical, plumbing, roof, or HVAC before writing a policy. If you have outbuildings, acreage, or a home-based business, your coverage needs differ from a typical subdivision home.

We know which carriers work well for Live Oak's housing stock and can help you navigate inspections, documentation, and requirements.
