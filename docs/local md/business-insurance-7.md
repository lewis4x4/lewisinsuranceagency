# Business Insurance in High Springs, Florida

High Springs has evolved from a railroad town to a destination known for its natural springs, outdoor recreation, and growing downtown district. Whether you run a kayak outfitter, a downtown restaurant, a construction company, or any other business serving this community, you need insurance that protects your operation.

## Essential Business Coverages

Most High Springs businesses need some combination of these protections:

**General Liability Insurance**
Covers claims of bodily injury, property damage, and advertising injury. If a customer is injured at your business or your operations damage someone's property, general liability responds.

**Commercial Property Insurance**
Protects your building, equipment, inventory, and business property against fire, theft, vandalism, and covered weather events. If you rent your space, your landlord's policy doesn't cover your belongings or improvements.

**Commercial Auto Insurance**
Required if you use vehicles for business purposes. Personal auto policies typically exclude business use, creating coverage gaps after work-related accidents.

**Workers' Compensation Insurance**
Required for most Florida businesses with four or more employees. Construction businesses need it with just one employee. Covers medical expenses and lost wages for employees injured on the job.

**Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions**
Covers claims from professional mistakes, bad advice, or service failures. Essential for consultants, guides, and service-based businesses.

Lewis Insurance Agency has been serving North Florida businesses since 1981. We understand the industries that thrive in High Springs:

- **Tourism and recreation**: Kayak outfitters, tubing operations, campgrounds, and guides need specialized liability coverage
- **Restaurants and retail**: Downtown businesses need property, liability, and often liquor liability

## Tourism Business Considerations

High Springs' economy benefits significantly from visitors drawn to the springs and rivers. If your business serves tourists, you face unique liability exposures:

- Injuries during recreational activities
- Equipment rental responsibilities
- Transportation liability
- Waiver effectiveness (waivers reduce but don't eliminate liability)

We work with carriers who understand recreational tourism and can structure appropriate coverage.
