# Mobile Home Insurance in Lake City, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing are a significant part of Columbia County's housing market. They're affordable, practical, and for thousands of Lake City area residents, they're home. But insuring them requires an agent who understands the differences between mobile home coverage and standard homeowners insurance.

## Why Mobile Homes Need Specialized Coverage

Mobile homes face unique risks. They're more susceptible to wind damage than site-built homes. Older models may not meet current tie-down or anchoring requirements. Some were built before HUD standards took effect in 1976, which affects both coverage options and pricing.

Many insurance carriers either don't write mobile home policies or charge excessive rates because they don't understand the North Florida market. At Lewis Insurance Agency, we've been insuring Lake City mobile homes since 1981. We know which carriers specialize in manufactured housing and offer fair rates for Columbia County residents.

## Coverage Options for Your Mobile Home

Whether you have a single-wide in a community, a double-wide on leased land, or a manufactured home on your own property, we can find coverage that fits:

- **Dwelling coverage** for the structure itself
- **Personal property protection** for your belongings inside
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured at your home
- **Other structures** for carports, storage buildings, and porches
- **Additional living expenses** if you're displaced after a covered loss

## Owned Land vs. Leased Lot

Your coverage needs differ based on whether you own the land under your mobile home or lease a lot in a community. We'll help you understand what's required in each situation and make sure you're not paying for coverage you don't need—or missing coverage you do.

## Older Mobile Homes Welcome

Some carriers won't insure mobile homes older than 20 or 30 years. Others require inspections or updated tie-downs. We work with companies that understand older manufactured homes and can often find coverage when others have said no.
