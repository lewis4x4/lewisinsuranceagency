# Auto Insurance in Branford, Florida

Branford sits along the Suwannee River in the heart of rural Suwannee County. If you live here, you know that getting anywhere—work, school, shopping—means driving. Whether you're commuting to Live Oak, Lake City, or Gainesville, or just getting around town, your vehicle is essential. You need auto insurance that protects you without breaking the bank.

## What Branford Drivers Should Know

Florida requires only $10,000 in PIP and $10,000 in property damage liability. That's barely enough to cover a minor accident. If you're seriously hurt or cause significant damage to someone else's vehicle, those minimums will be exhausted quickly—and you'll be on the hook for the rest.

Rural roads in Suwannee County bring their own risks: deer crossings, farm equipment sharing the road, limited visibility at night, and longer distances for emergency response. Your insurance should account for how and where you actually drive.

## Coverage Options

Lewis Insurance Agency has been helping Branford drivers since 1981. We work with multiple carriers to find coverage that fits your situation:

- **Liability coverage** to protect your assets when you're at fault
- **Collision coverage** for damage to your vehicle in an accident
- **Comprehensive coverage** for theft, vandalism, and weather damage
- **Uninsured motorist coverage** for accidents with drivers who have no insurance
- **Medical payments** for injuries beyond basic PIP limits
- **Roadside assistance** for breakdowns on rural roads

## Local Knowledge Matters

Branford is a small community where not every insurance carrier wants to write policies. We know which companies offer competitive rates for Suwannee County drivers and which ones to avoid. We can also help with SR-22 filings, multi-vehicle discounts, and coverage for teenage drivers.
