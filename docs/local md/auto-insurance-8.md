# Auto Insurance in Gainesville, Florida

Gainesville is North Central Florida's largest city, home to the University of Florida, major medical centers, and a diverse economy. Whether you're a student, a professional, a family, or a retiree, getting around Gainesville means driving—and you need auto insurance that protects you on these roads.

## What Gainesville Drivers Face

Gainesville traffic includes everything from student commuters to regional traffic on I-75, US-441, and the busy corridors connecting campus, downtown, and surrounding communities. Football game days and university events create their own traffic challenges. The mix of inexperienced student drivers, commercial vehicles, and daily commuters means accidents happen regularly.

Florida's minimum auto insurance—$10,000 PIP and $10,000 property damage—provides almost no real protection in this environment. A fender-bender with a newer vehicle can exceed those limits. A trip to Shands can exhaust your PIP coverage before you leave the parking lot.

## Coverage Options We Offer

Lewis Insurance Agency has been helping Gainesville drivers since 1981. We work with multiple carriers to find coverage that fits your situation:

- **Liability coverage** that actually protects your assets
- **Collision coverage** for damage to your vehicle in an accident
- **Comprehensive coverage** for theft, vandalism, and weather damage
- **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage** for accidents with drivers who have no or inadequate insurance
- **Medical payments coverage** beyond basic PIP
- **Rental reimbursement** while your vehicle is being repaired
- **Roadside assistance** for breakdowns anywhere

## Student Auto Insurance

University of Florida students have unique auto insurance needs. If you're on your parents' policy but attending school in Gainesville, that policy may still cover you—but rates and requirements vary. If you've purchased your own policy, we can help you find coverage that fits a student budget while providing real protection.

Students with good grades often qualify for discounts. Safe driving, completing defensive driving courses, and bundling with renters insurance can also reduce premiums.

## Multi-Car and Bundle Discounts

If your household has multiple vehicles, insuring them together typically saves money. Adding your homeowners, condo, or renters insurance to the same carrier often provides additional discounts. We'll quote everything together to find the best combination of coverage and price.

## Local Agents, Regional Expertise

Lewis Insurance Agency serves Gainesville, Alachua, High Springs, Newberry, Archer, and the surrounding areas. We're not a 1-800 number—we're local agents who understand Gainesville's driving environment.

Call us for an auto insurance quote. We'll review your current coverage and show you what's available.
