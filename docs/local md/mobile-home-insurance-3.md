# Mobile Home Insurance in Branford, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing are common throughout Branford and rural Suwannee County. They offer affordable homeownership in a community where land is available and cost of living matters. But insuring a mobile home requires understanding that differs from standard homeowners coverage—especially in a river community like Branford.

## Mobile Homes Need Specialized Coverage

Mobile homes face risks that site-built homes don't. They're more susceptible to wind damage during storms. Older units may not meet current tie-down and anchoring standards. And in Branford, proximity to the Suwannee River means flood risk is a real concern for many mobile home owners.

Many insurance carriers either won't write mobile home policies or charge excessive rates because they don't understand rural North Florida. Lewis Insurance Agency has been insuring Branford mobile homes since 1981. We work with carriers who specialize in manufactured housing and treat mobile home owners fairly.

## What's Covered

Whether you have a single-wide, double-wide, or modular home, we can find coverage that protects you:

- **Dwelling coverage** for the structure at replacement cost
- **Personal property** protection for everything inside
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured at your home
- **Other structures** for porches, carports, and storage buildings
- **Additional living expenses** if you need temporary housing after a loss

## Flood Risk for Mobile Homes

Branford's location along the Suwannee means some mobile home owners face significant flood risk. Your mobile home policy doesn't cover flood damage—that requires separate coverage. We can help you understand your flood zone designation and find affordable flood protection.

## Older Units Welcome

Some insurance companies won't cover mobile homes older than 20 or 30 years. Others have strict requirements for tie-downs, skirting, or electrical updates. We work with carriers who understand older manufactured homes and can often find coverage when others have turned you away.
