# Business Insurance in Gainesville, Florida

Gainesville's economy is driven by the University of Florida, major medical centers, technology companies, and the thousands of businesses that serve this diverse community. Whether you're running a restaurant on University Avenue, a medical practice, a construction company, or a tech startup, you need insurance that protects your business from the risks you face.

## Essential Business Coverages

Most Gainesville businesses need some combination of these protections:

**General Liability Insurance**
Covers claims of bodily injury, property damage, and advertising injury. If a customer slips in your store, if your work damages property, or if you're sued for a marketing claim, general liability responds.

**Commercial Property Insurance**
Protects your building (if owned), equipment, inventory, and business personal property against fire, theft, vandalism, and covered weather events. Essential whether you own or lease your space.

**Commercial Auto Insurance**
Required if you use vehicles for business purposes. Personal auto policies typically exclude business use, creating gaps that could leave you uninsured after work-related accidents.

**Workers' Compensation Insurance**
Required for most Florida businesses with four or more employees. Construction businesses need it with just one employee. Covers medical expenses and lost wages for employees injured on the job.

**Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions**
Covers claims arising from professional mistakes, advice, or services rendered. Essential for consultants, healthcare providers, attorneys, accountants, and technology professionals.

**Cyber Liability Insurance**
Covers data breaches, ransomware attacks, and cyber incidents. Increasingly important for any business that handles customer data, processes payments, or relies on technology.
