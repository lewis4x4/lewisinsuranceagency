# Auto Insurance in High Springs, Florida

High Springs sits at the northern edge of Alachua County where small-town charm meets easy access to Gainesville and I-75. Whether you're commuting to work in Gainesville, driving to Lake City, or exploring the springs and rivers that make this area famous, you need auto insurance that protects you on the road.

## What High Springs Drivers Need

Florida's minimum auto insurance—$10,000 PIP and $10,000 property damage—provides almost no real protection. A moderate fender-bender with a newer vehicle can exceed your property damage limits. A single trip to the emergency room can exhaust your PIP coverage. When your insurance runs out, creditors come after your personal assets.

High Springs drivers face diverse conditions: rural roads leading to springs and campgrounds, US-441 traffic, the I-75 interchange, and growing local traffic as the area develops. Your coverage should account for all of it.

## Coverage Options We Offer

Lewis Insurance Agency has been helping High Springs drivers since 1981. We work with multiple carriers to find coverage that fits your needs and budget:

- **Liability coverage** that actually protects your assets and future earnings
- **Collision coverage** for damage to your vehicle in an accident
- **Comprehensive coverage** for theft, vandalism, deer strikes, and weather damage
- **Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage** for accidents with drivers who have inadequate insurance
- **Medical payments coverage** beyond basic PIP
- **Roadside assistance** for breakdowns in rural areas

## Multi-Car and Bundle Discounts

If you have multiple vehicles in your household, insuring them together typically saves money. Adding your homeowners or renters insurance to the same carrier can provide additional discounts. We'll quote all your policies together to find the best combination.

Teenage drivers, clean driving records, and safety features on your vehicle can also reduce your premiums. We'll explore every available discount.
