# Business Insurance in Lake City, Florida

Lake City's economy runs on small and medium-sized businesses—contractors, trucking companies, medical offices, restaurants, retail shops, and service providers that keep Columbia County moving. If you own a business here, you need insurance that protects what you've built from the risks you face every day.

## Why Your Personal Insurance Won't Protect Your Business

Your homeowners policy won't cover equipment you use for work. Your personal auto insurance won't pay claims if an accident happens in a vehicle used for business purposes. And if a customer slips and falls at your location or gets hurt because of your work, your personal liability coverage won't help.

Business insurance fills these gaps. It protects your equipment, your vehicles, your employees, and your liability exposure—all the things your personal policies exclude.

## Coverage for Columbia County Businesses

Lewis Insurance Agency has been insuring Lake City businesses since 1981. We work with contractors, retailers, restaurants, professional services, healthcare providers, trucking companies, and agricultural operations throughout North Florida. We understand what coverage you need and what you can skip:

- **General liability** protects against third-party injury and property damage claims
- **Commercial property** covers your building, equipment, and inventory
- **Business owners policy (BOP)** bundles property and liability for small businesses
- **Workers compensation** covers employee injuries and meets Florida requirements
- **Commercial auto** for vehicles used in your business operations
- **Professional liability/E&O** for service providers and consultants
- **Cyber liability** for data breaches and digital threats

## Industry-Specific Expertise

Different businesses face different risks. A roofing contractor needs different coverage than a dental office or a restaurant. We don't sell generic packages—we look at your specific operation, your employees, your equipment, and your exposure, then build coverage that fits.

Lake City's I-75/I-10 location means many local businesses involve transportation, logistics, and services for travelers. We understand these industries and the carriers who specialize in them.

## Protect What You've Built

You've invested time, money, and effort into your business. One lawsuit, one accident, or one disaster shouldn't be able to take it all away. Lewis Insurance Agency serves businesses throughout Lake City, Live Oak, Gainesville, and all of North Florida.

Call us for a business insurance review. We'll identify gaps in your current coverage and show you options that make sense for your operation and your budget.
