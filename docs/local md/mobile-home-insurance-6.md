# Mobile Home Insurance in Mayo, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing are a practical housing choice throughout Lafayette County. They offer affordable homeownership in a county where space is abundant and housing costs remain reasonable. But insuring a mobile home isn't the same as insuring a site-built house, and you need an agent who understands the difference.

## Why Mobile Homes Need Specialized Insurance

Mobile homes face risks that site-built homes don't. They're more susceptible to wind damage during storms. Older models may not meet current anchoring and tie-down requirements. The materials and construction methods differ from traditional homes, affecting both risk profiles and repair costs.

Many insurance carriers either avoid mobile homes entirely or price them assuming worst-case scenarios. Lewis Insurance Agency works with carriers who specialize in manufactured housing and compete for this business with fair rates.

## What Your Policy Should Include

Proper mobile home insurance covers:

- **Dwelling protection**: The structure itself, including additions like rooms, carports, and porches
- **Personal property**: Your belongings inside the home
- **Liability coverage**: Protection if someone is injured on your property
- **Other structures**: Storage buildings, workshops, and detached carports
- **Additional living expenses**: Temporary housing if your home is damaged and uninhabitable

## Factors That Affect Your Coverage

Insurance companies evaluate mobile homes based on:

- **Year manufactured**: Homes built before 1976 predate HUD construction standards
- **Construction type**: Single-wide, double-wide, triple-wide
- **Tie-down system**: Proper anchoring reduces wind damage risk
- **Roof type and condition**: Metal, shingle, and overall condition matter
- **Location**: Flood zone, proximity to trees, and lot characteristics

If your mobile home has been declined by other carriers, talk to us. We often find coverage where others couldn't.
