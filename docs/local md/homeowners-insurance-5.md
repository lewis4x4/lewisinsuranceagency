# Homeowners Insurance in Jasper, Florida

Jasper homeowners enjoy the affordability and space that Hamilton County offers. Housing costs are well below state averages, and you can find acreage without paying coastal prices. But owning a home here still requires proper insurance protection against North Florida's weather, liability risks, and unexpected events.

## Understanding Your Coverage Needs

Standard homeowners insurance in Florida typically includes separate deductibles for hurricane and wind damage. On a $150,000 home—close to Hamilton County's median—a 2% hurricane deductible means $3,000 out of pocket before coverage applies. A 5% deductible means $7,500. This catches many homeowners off guard when they file claims after tropical storms or hurricanes.

Your policy should cover:

- **Dwelling coverage** to rebuild your home if destroyed
- **Other structures** like detached garages, barns, or workshops
- **Personal property** inside your home
- **Liability protection** if someone gets injured on your property
- **Additional living expenses** if you have to live elsewhere during repairs

## Flood and Sinkhole Considerations

Hamilton County has flood zones, particularly along the Alapaha and Withlacoochee rivers. Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. If you're in a designated flood zone, your lender will require separate flood insurance. Even if you're not in a high-risk zone, flood damage can happen anywhere—and FEMA data shows most flood claims come from properties outside high-risk areas.

North Florida also sits on karite terrain, which means sinkhole activity is possible. Standard policies exclude sinkhole damage unless you add specific coverage. Given the geology of this region, it's worth discussing this option with your agent.

## Older Homes and Insurance Requirements

Many Jasper homes are older and may require inspections before carriers will write a policy:

- **4-Point Inspection**: Covers roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems
- **Wind Mitigation Inspection**: Documents hurricane-resistant features that may qualify you for discounts

Lewis Insurance Agency can help you understand what's required and which carriers are more flexible with older homes.
