# Business Insurance in Jasper, Florida

Hamilton County's economy runs on agriculture, timber, small businesses, and the hardworking people who operate them. Whether you're running a farm, a logging operation, a repair shop, or a small retail business in Jasper, you need insurance that protects your livelihood from the risks you face every day.

## Essential Business Coverage

Most Jasper businesses need some combination of these coverages:

**General Liability Insurance**
Protects against claims of bodily injury, property damage, and advertising injury. If a customer slips and falls at your business, or if your work damages someone else's property, general liability responds.

**Commercial Property Insurance**
Covers your building, equipment, inventory, and business personal property against fire, theft, vandalism, and certain weather events. If you lease your space, your landlord's policy doesn't cover your stuff.

**Commercial Auto Insurance**
Required if you use vehicles for business purposes. Your personal auto policy typically excludes business use, creating a gap that could leave you uninsured after an accident.

**Workers' Compensation Insurance**
Required for most Florida businesses with four or more employees. Construction businesses need it with just one employee. Workers' comp covers medical expenses and lost wages for employees injured on the job.

**Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions**
Covers claims arising from professional mistakes, advice, or services rendered. Important for consultants, accountants, and service-based businesses.
