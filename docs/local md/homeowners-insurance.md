# Homeowners Insurance in Lake City, Florida

Lake City homeowners face a different set of risks than folks living in South Florida's coastal cities. While you're not dealing with ocean storm surge, North Florida sees its share of hurricanes, tropical storms, severe thunderstorms, and the occasional tornado that spins off during storm season.

## What Lake City Homeowners Need to Know

Standard homeowners insurance covers your dwelling, personal belongings, and liability if someone gets hurt on your property. But Florida policies often have separate deductibles for hurricane and wind damage—sometimes 2% to 5% of your home's insured value. On a $250,000 home, that's $5,000 to $12,500 out of pocket before your coverage kicks in.

Columbia County also has areas with flood risk, particularly near the Suwannee and Santa Fe rivers. Your homeowners policy doesn't cover flood damage—that requires a separate policy. We can help you determine your flood zone and whether you need additional coverage.

## Coverage That Fits North Florida Homes

Lewis Insurance Agency has been protecting Lake City homes since 1981. We understand the local housing stock—from newer construction in subdivisions to older homes on acreage, brick homes, frame homes, and everything in between.

We work with carriers who actively write policies in Columbia County, including options for:

- **Dwelling coverage** at replacement cost, not just market value
- **Personal property protection** for furniture, electronics, and belongings
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured on your property
- **Additional living expenses** if you're displaced after a covered loss
- **Other structures** coverage for detached garages, sheds, and fences

## Older Home? We Can Help

If your home is more than 20 years old, some carriers won't write a policy without updated electrical, plumbing, HVAC, or roof. We know which companies are more flexible and what documentation you'll need to qualify.

A 4-point inspection covers these major systems. A wind mitigation inspection can earn you discounts if your home has hurricane-resistant features. We'll walk you through what's required and what's optional.

## Get Protected Before Storm Season
