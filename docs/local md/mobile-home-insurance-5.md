# Mobile Home Insurance in Jasper, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing are common throughout Hamilton County. They provide affordable homeownership for families in Jasper, White Springs, Jennings, and the surrounding rural areas. But insuring a mobile home requires working with an agent who understands the unique challenges of manufactured housing coverage.

## Why Mobile Homes Need Specialized Coverage

Mobile homes face different risks than site-built houses. They're more vulnerable to wind damage during storms. Older units may not meet current tie-down and anchoring standards. Many insurance carriers either refuse to write mobile home policies or charge inflated rates because they don't actively compete in rural North Florida markets.

Lewis Insurance Agency has been insuring Jasper mobile homes since 1981. We work with carriers who specialize in manufactured housing and offer fair rates for Hamilton County residents.

## What Mobile Home Insurance Covers

A proper mobile home policy should include:

- **Dwelling coverage** for the structure itself
- **Personal property** protection for your belongings
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured on your property
- **Other structures** like carports, storage buildings, or decks
- **Additional living expenses** if your home becomes uninhabitable

## Age and Condition Factors

Insurance companies evaluate mobile homes differently based on:

- **Year built**: Pre-1976 units were built before HUD standards took effect
- **Anchoring system**: Proper tie-downs affect both eligibility and pricing
- **Roof type**: Metal roofs versus shingled roofs have different risk profiles
- **Overall condition**: Visible wear, outdated electrical, or plumbing issues can affect coverage options

We know which carriers are more flexible with older mobile homes and what documentation helps get approval. If your mobile home has been declined elsewhere, talk to us—we may have options.

## Protecting Your Investment

Your mobile home may represent a significant portion of your net worth. Proper insurance protects that investment against storms, fire, theft, and liability claims. Lewis Insurance Agency serves Jasper, White Springs, Jennings, and all of Hamilton County.
