# Boat Insurance in Branford, Florida

Branford is a river town. The Suwannee River defines this community, and boating is part of daily life for many residents. Whether you're fishing for bass, paddling the springs, or just cruising the river on a weekend afternoon, you need boat insurance that's designed for Suwannee River conditions—not a generic policy that doesn't understand freshwater river boating.

## Why Branford Boaters Need Real Coverage

The Suwannee River isn't a calm lake. Water levels change dramatically between wet and dry seasons. Submerged logs, stumps, and rocks appear without warning. The river narrows and bends, creating blind spots and navigation challenges. These conditions cause damage that a basic boat policy might not cover.

A cheap add-on to your homeowners insurance typically has low limits, excludes certain types of damage, and may not cover your boat while stored or being trailered. If you boat the Suwannee regularly, you need dedicated marine coverage.

## Coverage for River Boaters

Lewis Insurance Agency has been covering Branford boat owners since 1981. We work with marine insurance specialists who understand river boating—not just coastal or lake coverage. We insure:

- **Bass boats and fishing boats** built for Suwannee River fishing
- **Jon boats and aluminum boats** for utility and hunting
- **Pontoon boats** for family outings
- **Kayaks and canoes** for exploring the springs and tributaries
- **Personal watercraft** for recreation

## What's Protected

A proper boat policy covers the risks you actually face on the river:

- **Hull damage** from hitting submerged objects, docks, or sandbars
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured or you damage property
- **Theft protection** for your boat, motor, and trailer
- **Equipment coverage** for electronics, tackle, and accessories
- **Towing assistance** when you break down on the water
- **Trailer coverage** for transport to and from launch points

## River Boating Is Different

We'll make sure your policy accounts for the specific hazards of the Suwannee—fluctuating water levels, debris, and the unique risks of river navigation. Don't assume a generic policy covers you adequately.
