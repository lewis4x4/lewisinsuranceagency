# Homeowners Insurance in Jacksonville, Florida

Jacksonville's housing market spans from historic Springfield homes to beach condos, from Mandarin family neighborhoods to new construction in St. Johns County. Whatever type of home you own, protecting that investment requires insurance that addresses Northeast Florida's specific risks—including hurricanes, flooding, and the challenges of coastal and near-coastal properties.

## Understanding Jacksonville's Insurance Challenges

Northeast Florida has faced significant homeowners insurance market disruption. Major carriers have left the state or stopped writing new policies. Hurricane exposure, litigation costs, and roof claim frequency have all contributed to rising rates and reduced availability.

Finding coverage requires working with an agent who understands this market and has relationships with carriers still actively writing policies in Jacksonville.

## What Your Policy Should Cover

Comprehensive homeowners insurance protects:

- **Dwelling coverage**: Your home's structure at replacement cost
- **Other structures**: Detached garages, workshops, fences, and pool enclosures
- **Personal property**: Everything inside your home—furniture, electronics, clothing, appliances
- **Liability protection**: Coverage if someone is injured on your property
- **Additional living expenses**: Temporary housing if your home becomes uninhabitable

## Hurricane and Wind Deductibles

Florida homeowners policies typically have separate deductibles for hurricane damage—often 2% to 5% of your dwelling coverage. On a $400,000 home, a 2% hurricane deductible means $8,000 out of pocket before coverage applies.

Understanding your deductible structure before a storm is essential. We'll explain exactly what you'll pay and what your policy covers.

## Flood Insurance Is Not Optional

Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. In Jacksonville, with the St. Johns River, coastal areas, and significant flood zones throughout the city, flood insurance should be considered essential—even if your lender doesn't require it.

Federal flood maps don't capture all flood risk. Many flood claims come from properties outside designated high-risk zones. Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and private carriers.

## Roof Requirements and Inspections

Jacksonville carriers pay close attention to roof condition. Many won't write policies on roofs older than 15 years. Most require inspections before binding coverage:

- **4-Point Inspection**: Evaluates roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC
- **Wind Mitigation Inspection**: Documents hurricane-resistant features for potential discounts

Roof replacement can be expensive, but it often pays for itself through reduced premiums and improved insurability.

## Beach and Coastal Properties

If you own property at Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, Atlantic Beach, or Ponte Vedra, you face additional wind and flood exposure. Coastal properties may require specialized markets or higher premiums. We work with carriers who understand and actively insure coastal properties.
