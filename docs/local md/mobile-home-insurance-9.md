# Mobile Home Insurance in Jacksonville, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing provide affordable housing throughout the Jacksonville area—from mobile home communities in the urban core to properties on acreage in the surrounding counties. If you own a mobile home, you need insurance that recognizes the specific characteristics and risks of manufactured housing.

## Why Mobile Homes Need Specialized Coverage

Mobile homes face different risks than site-built houses. They're more susceptible to wind damage, which matters significantly in a hurricane-prone market like Jacksonville. Construction methods and materials differ from traditional homes. Older units may not meet current tie-down and anchoring standards.

Many insurance carriers either don't write mobile home policies or charge inflated rates. Lewis Insurance Agency works with carriers who specialize in manufactured housing and compete for this business.

## What Your Policy Should Cover

A complete mobile home insurance policy includes:

- **Dwelling coverage**: The structure itself, including additions and improvements
- **Personal property**: Your belongings inside the home
- **Liability protection**: Coverage if someone is injured on your property
- **Other structures**: Carports, storage buildings, and detached structures
- **Additional living expenses**: Temporary housing if your home is damaged

## Factors That Affect Your Coverage

Insurance companies evaluate mobile homes based on:

- **Year manufactured**: Homes built before 1976 predate HUD construction standards
- **Type**: Single-wide, double-wide, or larger configurations
- **Tie-down and anchoring**: Proper installation affects wind damage risk
- **Roof condition**: Age, type, and overall condition
- **Location**: Flood zone status, community type, proximity to coast

Jacksonville's hurricane exposure makes proper anchoring and roof condition particularly important for insurability and pricing.

## Flood Insurance for Mobile Homes

Jacksonville has significant flood risk areas, and mobile homes are especially vulnerable to flood damage. Standard policies don't cover flooding. If your mobile home is in or near a flood zone, flood insurance through NFIP or private carriers is essential.

## Mobile Home Communities vs. Private Land

Coverage requirements and options may differ based on whether your mobile home is in a community or on private land:

- **Community locations**: May have shared infrastructure coverage, but you still need your own policy for your home and belongings
- **Private land**: May need additional coverage for site improvements, wells, septic systems, and outbuildings

## Finding Coverage in a Challenging Market

Florida's insurance market has tightened significantly. Some carriers have stopped writing new mobile home policies entirely. Finding coverage requires working with an agent who has access to multiple markets and understands which carriers are actively writing business.

Lewis Insurance Agency serves mobile home owners throughout Jacksonville, the Westside, Northside, and surrounding areas. Call us for a quote tailored to your situation.
