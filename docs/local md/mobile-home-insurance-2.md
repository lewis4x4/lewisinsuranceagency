# Mobile Home Insurance in Live Oak, Florida

Mobile homes and manufactured housing are a major part of Suwannee County's housing market. They provide affordable homeownership for families throughout Live Oak, Branford, McAlpin, and the surrounding rural areas. But insuring a mobile home isn't the same as insuring a site-built house, and you need an agent who understands the difference.

## Why Mobile Homes Need Specialized Coverage

Mobile homes face different risks than traditional homes. They're more vulnerable to wind damage and severe weather. Older units may not meet current anchoring requirements. Many insurance carriers either refuse to write mobile home policies or charge inflated rates because they don't understand rural North Florida markets.

Lewis Insurance Agency has been insuring Live Oak mobile homes since 1981. We work with carriers who specialize in manufactured housing and offer fair rates for Suwannee County residents—not companies that treat mobile homes as an afterthought.

## Coverage for Your Manufactured Home

Whether you own a single-wide, double-wide, or newer modular home, we can find coverage that protects you:

- **Dwelling coverage** for the structure itself at replacement cost
- **Personal property protection** for everything inside your home
- **Liability coverage** if someone is injured at your home
- **Other structures** for porches, carports, sheds, and storage buildings
- **Additional living expenses** if you need temporary housing after a loss

## Your Land or a Leased Lot

Coverage requirements differ based on whether your mobile home sits on land you own or in a community where you lease the lot. We'll explain the differences and make sure you have the coverage you need—without paying for things you don't.

## Older Mobile Homes Accepted

Some carriers won't touch mobile homes older than 20 or 30 years. Others have strict inspection requirements. We work with companies that understand older manufactured housing and can often find coverage when other agents have said no.

If your mobile home needs updated tie-downs, skirting, or other improvements to qualify, we'll tell you exactly what's needed.
