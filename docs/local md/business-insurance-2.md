# Business Insurance in Live Oak, Florida

Live Oak's economy is built on agriculture, forestry, small manufacturing, and the service businesses that support Suwannee County's residents. Whether you're running a timber operation, a farm, a retail shop on Howard Street, or a service company, you need business insurance that protects what you've worked to build.

## Your Personal Insurance Won't Cover Your Business

This is where many Live Oak business owners get caught off guard. Your homeowners policy doesn't cover equipment you use for work. Your personal auto insurance excludes accidents in vehicles used for business purposes. And if a customer or employee gets hurt because of your operations, your personal liability won't help.

Business insurance exists to fill these gaps. It protects your equipment, your vehicles, your employees, and your exposure to lawsuits—all the things your personal policies specifically exclude.

## Coverage for Suwannee County Businesses

Lewis Insurance Agency has been insuring Live Oak businesses since 1981. We understand the industries that drive this area's economy:

- **Contractors and construction** — general liability, tools and equipment, workers comp
- **Agriculture and farming** — farm equipment, liability, crop operations
- **Forestry and timber** — logging operations, equipment, transportation
- **Retail and restaurants** — property, liability, business income
- **Professional services** — errors and omissions, cyber liability
- **Transportation and trucking** — commercial auto, cargo, physical damage

## What You Need

Most Live Oak businesses need some combination of:

- **General liability** for third-party injury and property damage claims
- **Commercial property** for your building, equipment, and inventory
- **Workers compensation** if you have employees (Florida requires this)
- **Commercial auto** for vehicles used in your business
- **Business owners policy (BOP)** bundling property and liability for smaller operations
- **Professional liability** for service-based businesses

## We Know Rural Business Risks

Operating a business in a rural county comes with challenges that city-focused insurance agents don't always understand. We know the carriers who write policies for agricultural operations, timber companies, and small-town businesses. We understand seasonal fluctuations, equipment-intensive operations, and the liability exposures that come with North Florida's industries.

## Protect Your Livelihood

You've invested too much to let an accident, lawsuit, or disaster wipe it out. Lewis Insurance Agency serves businesses throughout Live Oak, Branford, McAlpin, and all of Suwannee County.

Call us for a business insurance review. We'll look at your operation and show you coverage that fits—without selling you things you don't need.
