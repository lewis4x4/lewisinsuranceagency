# Boat Insurance in Gainesville, Florida

Gainesville's location provides access to excellent boating throughout North Central Florida. Local lakes like Newnans Lake, Lake Santa Fe, and Orange Lake offer freshwater fishing and recreation. The springs and rivers to the north—the Santa Fe, Ichetucknee, and Suwannee—are within easy reach. Many Gainesville boaters trailer to the Gulf Coast for saltwater fishing. Wherever you boat, you need insurance that protects your investment.

## Why Boat Insurance Matters

Your homeowners or renters policy may provide limited coverage for small boats, but it typically has low limits and significant gaps. A dedicated boat insurance policy provides:

- **Hull coverage**: Physical damage to your boat from accidents, storms, or sinking
- **Liability protection**: Coverage if you cause damage to other boats, docks, or injury to others
- **Medical payments**: Medical expenses for you and your passengers
- **Uninsured boater coverage**: Protection from boaters without insurance
- **Personal property**: Fishing equipment, electronics, and gear
- **Trailer coverage**: Your boat trailer during transport and storage

## Boats We Insure

Lewis Insurance Agency works with carriers who understand recreational boating in Florida. We insure:

- **Bass boats** and fishing boats
- **Pontoon boats**
- **Jon boats** and aluminum craft
- **Center console boats**
- **Kayaks and canoes** (often covered under homeowners, but we can verify limits)
- **Paddleboards**
- **Personal watercraft** (jet skis, wave runners)

## Freshwater and Saltwater Coverage

Gainesville boaters often use their boats in multiple environments—local lakes, spring-fed rivers, and Gulf Coast saltwater. Your policy should cover you everywhere you go, not just one type of water.

Saltwater use typically costs more to insure because it's harder on boats and presents different risks. If you trailer to Cedar Key, Steinhatchee, or the Crystal River area, make sure your policy reflects that usage.

## Storage and Transportation

Your boat is at risk during storage and transport—not just on the water. Whether you store at home, in a dry stack facility, or on a trailer, your coverage should protect against theft, vandalism, and weather damage. Trailer accidents during transport should also be covered.

If you store your boat seasonally, some policies offer reduced rates for declared layup periods.
