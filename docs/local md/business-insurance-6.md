# Business Insurance in Mayo, Florida

Lafayette County's economy depends on agriculture, timber, and the small businesses that serve this close-knit community. Whether you're running a cattle operation, a timber company, a small retail shop, or a service business in Mayo, you need insurance that protects your livelihood from the risks you face.

## Core Business Coverages

Most Mayo businesses need some combination of these protections:

**General Liability Insurance**
Protects your business from claims of bodily injury, property damage, and advertising injury. If a customer slips and falls, or your work damages someone's property, general liability responds.

**Commercial Property Insurance**
Covers your buildings, equipment, inventory, and business property against fire, theft, vandalism, and covered weather events. Essential whether you own your building or just the contents.

**Commercial Auto Insurance**
Required if you use vehicles for business purposes. Your personal auto policy likely excludes business use, leaving you uninsured after an accident while working.

**Workers' Compensation Insurance**
Required for most Florida businesses with four or more employees. Construction and agricultural businesses may need it with fewer employees. Covers medical expenses and lost wages for workplace injuries.

**Farm and Ranch Insurance**
Specialized coverage for agricultural operations including liability, equipment, livestock, and crop coverage.

## Industries We Serve

Lewis Insurance Agency has been serving Lafayette County businesses since 1981. We understand the industries that drive this region:

- **Cattle ranches and farms**: Livestock coverage, equipment, liability, and specialized agricultural coverage
- **Timber operations**: Commercial auto for logging trucks, liability, workers' comp for high-risk work
- **Equipment and repair shops**: Property, liability, garage keepers coverage
- **Retail and service businesses**: Property, general liability, business interruption
- **Contractors**: General liability, tools and equipment, bonds

## Why Local Matters

Lafayette County businesses face different challenges than businesses in urban areas. Longer response times, seasonal fluctuations, equipment-intensive operations, and a workforce that may be hard to replace all affect your risk profile and coverage needs.

We're not a distant call center. We're local agents who understand Mayo's business community and the carriers who offer fair coverage for businesses in small, rural counties.

## Protect What You've Built

Your business represents years of hard work and investment. One lawsuit, one accident, or one disaster shouldn't be able to take it away.

Lewis Insurance Agency serves businesses throughout Mayo, Day, and all of Lafayette County. Call us for a business insurance review. We'll identify your exposures and find coverage that makes sense.
