# Homeowners Insurance in High Springs, Florida

High Springs offers a unique blend of small-town living, natural beauty, and proximity to Gainesville's amenities. Home values have appreciated as more people discover what makes this area special. Protecting your investment requires homeowners insurance that addresses North Florida's specific risks.

## Understanding Your Coverage

Standard homeowners insurance in Florida includes separate deductibles for hurricane and wind damage. On a $300,000 home—increasingly common in High Springs—a 2% hurricane deductible means $6,000 out of pocket before coverage applies. These deductibles can surprise homeowners when they file claims after storms.

Your policy should protect:

- **Dwelling coverage**: Your home's structure, including attached garages and porches
- **Other structures**: Detached workshops, storage buildings, and fences
- **Personal property**: Furniture, appliances, electronics, clothing—everything inside
- **Liability protection**: Coverage if someone is injured on your property
- **Additional living expenses**: Temporary housing if your home becomes uninhabitable

## Flood Insurance Considerations

High Springs sits on the Florida aquifer with numerous springs, rivers, and low-lying areas. The Santa Fe River, Ichetucknee River, and countless smaller waterways create flood risk throughout the area.

Standard homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. If you're in a designated flood zone, your lender will require flood insurance. Even outside high-risk zones, flooding can occur anywhere—and FEMA data shows that a significant percentage of flood claims come from properties not in designated flood zones.

Lewis Insurance Agency can help you evaluate your flood risk and find appropriate coverage.

## Sinkhole and Earth Movement

Alachua County sits on karst terrain, which means sinkhole activity is possible. Standard homeowners policies exclude sinkhole damage unless you add catastrophic ground cover collapse coverage or purchase specific sinkhole coverage. Given the geology of this region, this is worth discussing with your agent.

## Older and Historic Homes

High Springs has many older homes with character and charm. These homes may require inspections before carriers will write policies:

- **4-Point Inspection**: Evaluates roof, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems
- **Wind Mitigation Inspection**: Documents hurricane-resistant features for potential discounts

We know which carriers work well with High Springs' older housing stock and can guide you through requirements.
