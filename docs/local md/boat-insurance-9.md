# Boat Insurance in Jacksonville, Florida

Jacksonville is a boating city. The St. Johns River runs through the heart of the metro area. The Intracoastal Waterway connects to the Atlantic beaches. Offshore fishing in the Atlantic, inshore fishing in the backwaters, bass fishing on the river—Jacksonville boaters do it all. If you own a boat, you need insurance that protects your investment across all these waters.

## Why Boat Insurance Matters

Your homeowners policy may provide limited coverage for small boats, but it typically has low limits and significant gaps. Jacksonville's diverse boating environment—from the river to the ocean—requires dedicated boat insurance:

- **Hull coverage**: Physical damage to your boat from accidents, storms, or sinking
- **Liability protection**: Coverage if you cause damage to other boats, docks, or injury to others
- **Medical payments**: Medical expenses for you and your passengers
- **Uninsured boater coverage**: Protection from boaters without adequate insurance
- **Personal property**: Fishing equipment, electronics, and gear
- **Trailer coverage**: Your boat trailer during transport and storage
- **Wreck removal**: Required in Florida waters if your boat sinks

## Boats We Insure

Lewis Insurance Agency works with carriers who understand both freshwater and saltwater boating in Northeast Florida:

- **Center console boats** and offshore fishing boats
- **Bay boats** and flats boats for inshore fishing
- **Bass boats** for river and lake fishing
- **Pontoon boats**
- **Cabin cruisers** and larger vessels
- **Personal watercraft** (jet skis, wave runners)
- **Kayaks, paddleboards, and small craft**

## Saltwater vs. Freshwater Coverage

Saltwater boating presents different risks and typically costs more to insure. Salt corrosion, offshore weather, and different navigation hazards all affect risk. If you boat both the St. Johns River and the Atlantic, your policy should cover both environments.

Where you keep your boat matters too. Marina storage, dry stack, on a lift, or on a trailer at home all have different risk profiles.

## Hurricane Season Considerations

Jacksonville's hurricane exposure means your boat faces seasonal risk even when not on the water. Your policy should cover:

- Storm damage while in storage
- Haul-out costs if a named storm approaches
- Damage during evacuation or repositioning

Understanding your hurricane coverage before storm season is essential.

## Commercial Use

If you use your boat for charter fishing, tours, or any commercial purpose, standard recreational boat insurance won't cover you. Commercial marine insurance addresses the specific liabilities of for-hire operations.
