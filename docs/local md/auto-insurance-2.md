# Auto Insurance in Live Oak, Florida

Live Oak serves as the heart of Suwannee County, where US-129 and US-90 bring steady traffic through town while rural roads connect farms, timber operations, and small communities throughout the county. Whether you're driving to work in town, hauling equipment on back roads, or commuting to Lake City or Gainesville, you need auto insurance that fits how you actually drive.

## What Live Oak Drivers Face

Suwannee County roads see a mix of local traffic, logging trucks, farm equipment, and travelers heading to the Suwannee River or passing through to other destinations. Rural roads mean deer crossings, limited lighting, and longer response times if something goes wrong.

Florida's minimum coverage—$10,000 PIP and $10,000 property damage—barely covers a trip to the emergency room or a fender bender with a newer vehicle. Live Oak drivers who rely on their vehicles for work or have assets to protect need more than the bare minimum.

## Coverage That Makes Sense

Lewis Insurance Agency has been helping Live Oak drivers since 1981. We don't push you toward the cheapest policy that checks a legal box. We ask about your situation—your commute, your vehicles, your household drivers, your assets—and find coverage that actually protects you.

We work with multiple carriers to compare:

- **Liability coverage** that protects your savings and property if you're at fault
- **Collision and comprehensive** for damage to your own vehicle
- **Uninsured motorist coverage** for accidents with drivers who have no insurance
- **Medical payments** beyond basic PIP limits
- **Roadside assistance** for breakdowns on rural Suwannee County roads

## Local Factors That Matter

Suwannee County's rural character affects your insurance options. Some carriers don't write many policies out here. Others offer better rates for drivers with clean records in less congested areas. We know which companies offer competitive rates for Live Oak residents.

Need to add a teenage driver? Looking for an SR-22? Have an older vehicle that needs liability-only coverage? We handle all of it.

## Your Neighbors, Not a Call Center

Lewis Insurance Agency serves Live Oak, Branford, McAlpin, Wellborn, and all of Suwannee County. We're local agents who understand this community—not someone in another state reading from a script.

Stop by or call us for an auto insurance quote. We'll show you what's available and help you make an informed decision.
