const faqs = [
    {
        question: "Does using an independent agent cost more?",
        answer: "No. Insurance carriers compensate agents, not policyholders. Your premium remains the same whether you buy through an agent or directly. An independent agent provides the added value of comparing multiple carriers for your coverage.",
    },
    {
        question: "What information do you need to compare quotes?",
        answer: "For auto, we need driver information, vehicle details, and driving history. For homeowners, we need your address, property details, roof age, and any updates. Properties near the springs or rivers may have additional flood zone considerations worth discussing.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you shop multiple carriers at renewal?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We review your policies at renewal and can shop alternatives if rates change or better options become available. This ongoing flexibility is a key reason people work with independent agents.",
    },
    {
        question: "What affects my insurance rate in Fort White?",
        answer: "Auto rates depend on driving record, vehicle type, coverage, and how you use your car. Home insurance considers roof age, construction type, updates, flood zone status, and distance from fire services. Rural locations have specific rate factors.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do hurricane deductibles work in Florida?",
        answer: "Florida homeowners policies include separate wind/hurricane deductibles, usually 2% of dwelling coverage. For a $175,000 home, your hurricane deductible would be $3,500 versus a standard $1,000 deductible for other claims.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you help me if I have a claim?",
        answer: "We help you understand your coverage and the claims process. Claims decisions are made by the insurance carrier, but we guide you through filing and answer questions along the way. We're here to help explain what's typically needed.",
    },
    {
        question: "How fast can I get proof of insurance?",
        answer: "Usually same day once your coverage is bound. Auto ID cards, certificates of insurance, and evidence of coverage can be provided quickly when you need documentation.",

                                Proximity to the springs and rivers creates flood considerations for some properties. Standard homeowners insurance doesn't cover flood damage—separate flood coverage may be needed depending on your property's location. Wind coverage is included in homeowners policies, but Florida's hurricane deductible structure (typically 2% of dwelling value) differs from regular deductibles.

                                Florida auto insurance requires PIP coverage. Your rates depend on driving history, vehicle type, coverage limits, and how you use your vehicle. An agent familiar with {county} County's rural character can help ensure your coverage matches your needs.
