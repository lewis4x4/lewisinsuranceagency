const faqs = [
    {
        question: "Does using an independent agent cost more?",
        answer: "No. Insurance companies pay agent commissions—clients don't pay extra. Your premium is the same whether you buy direct or through an agent. Independent agents add value by comparing multiple carriers for you.",
    },
    {
        question: "What information do you need to compare quotes?",
        answer: "For auto, we need driver information, vehicle details, and driving history. For homeowners, we need address, property details, roof information, and any recent updates. Complete information leads to accurate quotes.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you shop multiple carriers at renewal?",
        answer: "Yes. We review policies at renewal and can shop alternatives if rates increase or better options become available. This ability to move between carriers is a core advantage of independent agencies.",
    },
    {
        question: "What affects my insurance rate in Jasper?",
        answer: "Auto rates depend on driving record, vehicle, coverage limits, and commute patterns—including I-75 travel. Home insurance considers roof age, construction, updates, and distance from fire services. Hamilton County's rural nature affects some factors.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do hurricane deductibles work?",
        answer: "Florida homeowners policies have separate wind/hurricane deductibles, usually 2% of dwelling coverage. A $160,000 home would have a $3,200 hurricane deductible versus perhaps a $1,000 or $2,500 standard deductible.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you help me if I have a claim?",
        answer: "We help you understand the claims process and what's typically required. Claims decisions are made by the insurance carrier, but we guide you through filing, explain your coverage, and answer questions along the way.",
    },
    {
        question: "How fast can I get proof of insurance?",
        answer: "Usually same day once coverage is bound. Auto ID cards, certificates of insurance, and evidence of property coverage can be provided quickly when you need documentation.",

                                {city} serves as the county seat of {county} County, positioned near {localEntities[0]} and along {localEntities[1]}. Properties in {localEntities[2]} and throughout the {localEntities[3]} have varying characteristics that influence insurance considerations.

                                While {county} County is inland, wind coverage remains part of homeowners insurance in Florida. The hurricane deductible—typically 2% of dwelling coverage—applies regardless of coastal proximity. Roof age and condition significantly affect both coverage availability and pricing throughout the state.

                                For auto insurance, Florida requires PIP coverage. Driving patterns—including {localEntities[0]} commutes—vehicle type, and coverage limits all affect your rates. An agent who understands {county} County's character can help match coverage to your needs.
