const faqs = [
    {
        question: "Does using an independent agent cost more?",
        answer: "No. Carriers compensate agents through commissions—you don't pay extra. Your premium stays the same whether purchased directly or through an agent. The advantage is having someone compare multiple carriers on your behalf.",
    },
    {
        question: "What information do you need to compare quotes?",
        answer: "For auto, we need driver details, vehicle information, and driving history. For homeowners, we need your address, construction details, roof age, and any updates. For rural properties, we also discuss outbuildings and acreage.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you shop multiple carriers at renewal?",
        answer: "Yes. We review your policies annually and can compare options from different carriers if rates change or circumstances warrant. This flexibility is why many people prefer independent agencies.",
    },
    {
        question: "What affects my insurance rate in Mayo?",
        answer: "For auto, driving record, vehicle type, coverage levels, and usage patterns matter. For homes, roof condition, construction type, updates, fire district distance, and claims history affect rates. Lafayette County's rural character influences several factors.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do Florida wind deductibles work?",
        answer: "Florida homeowners policies have separate hurricane/wind deductibles, typically 2% of dwelling coverage. On a $140,000 home, that's a $2,800 wind deductible versus perhaps $1,000 for other claims. Understanding this before storm season matters.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can you help me if I have a claim?",
        answer: "We guide you through the process and help you understand what documentation is typically needed. Claims decisions are made by the insurance carrier, but we explain your coverage and answer questions as things progress.",
    },
    {
        question: "How fast can I get proof of insurance?",
        answer: "Typically same day once coverage is bound. We provide auto ID cards, certificates of insurance, and evidence of property coverage quickly when you need documentation.",

                                {city} serves as the county seat of {county} County, with {localEntities[0]} connecting the community to neighboring areas. The {localEntities[2]} is characterized by {localEntities[3]} and rural properties, from {localEntities[1]} to farms and acreage.

                                Rural properties have specific insurance considerations—distance from fire stations, outbuildings, and land use all affect coverage. Wind coverage is included in homeowners policies throughout Florida, with hurricane deductibles typically 2% of dwelling value. Roof condition remains a key factor for both coverage availability and pricing.

                                Auto insurance in Florida requires PIP coverage. Rural driving patterns, vehicle types, and how you use your car all influence rates. An agent familiar with {county} County understands these local factors.
